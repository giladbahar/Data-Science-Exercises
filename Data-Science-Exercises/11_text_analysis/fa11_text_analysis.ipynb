      "...and, finally, the little spot under your nose. Next, we take some toilet paper, tear off some teensy little squares, and stick one there, and there, and any place you're bleeding. There and there. Don't worry, the blood will hold it right on your face. Now, some aftershave.\n",

      "Goodnight, Krusty. Sorry about your dad.\n",
      "Why did this happen? Whyyyyyy?\n",

      "Oh, man.\n",
      "Let's call the company.\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "Really? Well, what do you call that thing on the branch?\n",
      "I never apologize, Lisa. I'm sorry, but that's just the way I am.\n",
      "I'm sorry all right! Sorry I came back here!\n",
      "You gotta give her up.\n",
      "Dad, did you see anything provocative in today's paper?\n",
      "All right, but remember it's mine.\n",
      "Fine.\n",
      "Eww, Dad, this is blood.\n",
      "Please! I went through my T.R. phase in first grade. Now I realize that the greatest Roosevelt is Franklin.\n",
      "Oh, here we go.\n",
      "Yeah. It seems like our house, but everything's got a creepy Pat Boone-ish quality to it.\n",
      "That's a wonderful thing you did for my sisters.\n",
      "I can't believe you're gambling.\n",
      "So... you're saying this fish might have an advantage over other fish. It may, in fact, be a kind of super fish!\n",
      "Isn't that nice? Take a message. Right now I'm off to hit forty-six local merchants for free birthday goods and services.\n",
      "Oh my God. Oh my God. This counts as a walk!\n",
      "Well, you always miss when you throw your underpants at the hamper!\n",
      "Any chance I could see you again?\n",
      "I'm the president and the decision is mine. We're Hell's Satans. Besides, I've already made our club jackets.\n",
      "Grampa, no stories! You can come with us, or sit here on the shark bench.\n",
      "When will all those fools learn that you can be perfectly healthy simply eating vegetables, fruits, grains, and cheese?\n",
      "Isn't there like a pound where you can pick up cheap ponies that ran away from home?\n",
      "Oh, that. I stuck a couple of extra legs on there 'cause I kept tipping over when I was trying to invent stuff.\n",
      "But Marge, look at the little guy!\n",
      "Oh man, I would love to pirate that.\n",
      "Homie, read this.\n",
      "No more reality shows for us. Let's watch some quality scripted television.\n",
      "Sort of!\n",
      "Unkink the hose!\n",
      "I'm not allowed to discuss that with fourth graders. Fifth grade, you get every dirty detail.\n",
      "I have to admit, I'll miss having him around.\n",
      "They're coming for-- What's your name?\n",
      "Nice try, Mr. Flanders, but I've got a story so scary you'll wet your pants.\n",
      "Yeah! Do that!\n",
      "That Ralph Wiggum boy. He's a real winner.\n",
      "Excellent.\n",
      "Wow, the TV's hooked up to the internet! You can stream whole seasons of old TV shows.\n",
      "Well, take your mind off contaminates for one night and have a hot dog.\n",
      "It is, 'cause my baby's not in it!\n",
      "I wish I'd gotten to know you better, Dad. But there were times when we really connected.\n",
      "Hey, let's go! Emergency! Life-or-death here!\n",
      "But there's no reason we can't dance, dance, dance the night away.\n",
      "Oh, their school system's the best. Their auditorium and their gym are two different rooms!\n",
      "Ah, my high school yearbook...\n",
      "My dad's always been so angry. Maybe if we help him be who he is, he'll finally be happy.\n",
      "Mr. Burns, I insist that we cheat!\n",
      "Lumbar! It means lower back. How many times will you make that mistake?\n",
      "I engaged in intercourse with your spouse or significant other. Now that's psychiatry! Eh? Eh?\n",
      "Nice tux, Moe.\n",
      "Which one?\n",
      "Hey, where's your candy?\n",
      "Now listen. I'm bringing Michael Jackson home to stay with us for a few days... Isn't that cute -- he's heard of you! Now, make sure we have plenty of cold cuts, and put some beer on ice.\n",
      "So, Mr. Lassen, you began your career at Shelbyville Prep.\n",
      "Your devotion to scholarship is a shining beacon to all who--\n",
      "Oh, all right, let me talk to them. Put me on with the lead boy.\n",
      "Not this! Anything but this!\n",
      "Ugh... oh... umph... Oh, Smithers, guide me in.\n",
      "Sideshow Bob! I'm only ten and I already got two mortal enemies.\n",
      "The only dangerous amount is none!\n",
      "Uh, Dad...\n",
      "Eh, I've had a good run.\n",
      "...so they need a place to stay. Here.\n",
      "Woo hoo!\n",
      "Oh, my.\n",
      "Heh, heh, heh. Tremendous.\n",
      "Oh, I don't think Mr. Burns would like that show.\n",
      "Ooh, marriage!\n",
      "Honeymooners -- no kids, no worries.\n",
      "Dad, we need to have a talk.\n",
      "Milhouse? Is that you?\n",
      "No, I won't accept that.\n",
      "Wha...?!\n",
      "Lisa, I think you're going to fit in just fine around here.\n",
      "I am?\n",
      "That's great, let me run the numbers because I really want the Simpson account. And give these cigars to your children.\n",
      "This is it, Marge. I poured my heart and soul into this business, and now it's finally paying off! We're rich! Richer than astronauts!\n",
      "A gutter cleaning coupon?\n",
      "I wanted them till I got them! But this year I'm gettin' my dirt bike.\n",
      "Hi, Homer Simpson. Mind if I sit near your son? Mine sucks.\n",
      "...I want you to have a fun night doing guy stuff. Don't worry about me, I'll be fine.\n",
      "Why you little...\n",
      "Oh. Hi Dad.\n",
      "Dinner time! I know you're hungry! I can hear you rubbing your legs together! Oh my God!\n",
      "I'm a freakin' Buddhist! A Buddhist!\n",
      "I bet you could afford it, though.\n",
      "Ow! Oh! Call work and tell 'em I won't be in tomorrow.\n",
      "I really appreciate your taking such an interest in me, Dad.\n",
      "Oh, Bart, thank you so, so much!\n",
      "Hey, Homer! Check it out!\n",
      "Okay Bart, we've got a lot of work to do on that car. So, I'm gonna pull you out of school for the next couple of weeks...\n",
      "No.\n",
      "Don't worry, I'll help her out. I remember how hard it was to be an outsider. Always trying to fit in... never quite feeling like...\n",
      "All right, Dolphins!\n",
      "Marge, I know this is ill-gotten, but can we use it to...\n",
      "Oh, hello Homer.\n",
      "No, they might escape and breed. The law is very clear on this: they must be exterminated as quickly and as gruesomely as possible.\n",
      "You mean, I'm on my own? I've never been on my own. Oh no! On own! On own! I need help. Oh, God help me! Help me, God!\n",
      "No foot-longs!\n",
      "Oh, goodbye, old girl. We've had a lot of great memories.\n",
      "Bart! Did you kill that poor bird?\n",
      "Ah, she got homesick for her old life, diving for tourist pennies in a Micronesian swamp.\n",
      "Interesting attitude for a janitor. What say we make you the new supervisor of Sector 7-G?!\n",
      "What in blazes? Who is that old geezer? And what has he done with Homer Simpson?\n",
      "I think we should do a test.\n",
      "Ach! It was that darn recording again!\n",
      "Hmm. This one's done in different handwriting.\n",
      "Uh, I dunno. But lucky for you somebody here is responsible.\n",
      "That's not an FBI badge.\n",
      "Hey, it'll be easy. You've still got most of the stuff from Apu's wedding back there.\n",
      "Bart, there's one left and it's mine!\n",
      "All right, the first thing they told me to do is make sure everyone here is in the right class.\n",
      "Oh, this is a parent's worst nightmare! They've stolen a car and they're home alone.\n",
      "I am in your power.\n",
      "What about now?\n",
      "Ah, Ziggy... will you ever win?\n",
      "Not half as good as cyberfudge.\n",
      "No, Chief, Bob's innocent! It's the truth!\n",
      "Who does Nelson think he's impressing, anyway, acting so cool all the time?\n",
      "Uh, Dad?\n",
      "Mmm! Cursive!\n",
      "Mom, I need more O.J.\n",
      "Into the playpen, sweetie. And if you get hungry, there's lobster!\n",
      "Dad, don't act like Mussolini!\n",
      "I was trying to gnaw my foot off, but I couldn't get through my sock. Goodnight everybody.\n",
      "Sorry, offer's expired. I guess we'll just have to let the jury decide, twelve good men and true. Good day. Smithers, release the hounds.\n",
      "Make it snappy, Milhouse. I've got an important meeting in the teachers' lounge.\n",
      "I cheated!\n",
      "All right, then. Uh, how about this?\n",
      "Awww...\n",
      "Ooh, that's a great idea.\n",
      "You know, Mom and Dad are almost forty, and Bart is ten. That means you didn't have him until way after high school.\n",
      "No, no, just give them each a nickel and send them to Moe's. Let them while away the afternoon spilling their beer on gullets and trousers whilst drooling over French postcards.\n",
      "We're not going to a Grammar Rodeo! That was just an alibi, Milton!!\n",
      "Why can't you support my gibberish? I'd do it if you were stupid!\n",
      "...Badge of honor.\n",
      "Uh, kids... don't forget about our special plans Saturday night.\n",
      "Allll right, I hear ya, honey. Change into something nice. We're steppin' out!\n",
      "I hope Maggie and the boys are all right.\n",
      "Now, promise me you'll leave her be, and wipe down your back seats annually...\n",
      "Yes, I do. You seem so damn sure.\n",
      "No, she's not.\n",
      "Yes I do. Under chapter thirteen of the fiscal code, an individual whose debts exceed his assets may file for bankruptcy, thus protecting said assets.\n",
      "How many grades does this school have?\n",
      "In the impulse zone. If you want to be like me, you gotta make snap decisions. Like this.\n",
      "So you're saying...\n",
      "It'll be a long time before your Mother gets back with the tire, so why don't I tell you more of the story? Now that we had a name, the Be Sharps needed a hit. Something new, something exciting, something mid-1980's...\n",

      "Let's go now... Sa-winggg, batter!\n",
      "Marge, it's so great to have the whole family together under one roof. I never realized how much I missed it. Listen to the murmurs in the next room. The house is full of life again.\n",
      "Dad, you tried your best. For the first time in my life I can say, without being drunk, that I truly admire you.\n",
      "I'm gonna get there early, so I can get in good with the lunch truck guy.\n",
      "Well, it's somewhere! It didn't just get up and walk away!\n",

      "Apu, you shoulda seen your face when they showed you those babies.\n",
      "Isn't that a little big?\n",
      "Don't worry. Everything is fine. What the hell is that?\n",
      "Well, the drug company won't do anything to help us.\n",

      "What I want can't be bought at any store.\n",
      "Thank you! Thank you! But there was someone else with me on that alley. I'm talkin' about the big man, Carl.\n",
      "My name is Moe Szyslak, and I'm here to elect me!\n",
      "I mean it made me feel bad. The poor thing ends up being hauled to the nut house when all she needed was for that big slob to show her some respect. At least that's what I thought. I have a history of missing the point of stuff like this.\n",
      "Well, you're closing. It's getting late. My kids are probably wondering where their daddy is. There's gotta be some other place we can go. Think, Moe. Think.\n",
      "Wait a minute... that guy on the poster looks familiar.\n",
      "Why, you clattering clank of.... My dear lady, as you well know my back is a disaster area. D'oh the pain! D'oh the pain of it all!\n",
      "What'd I do?\n",
      "I'll never forget you.\n",
      "Maybe you'd like to give it a try?\n",
      "Hey, this maze is made of corn!\n",
      "My only fear is, I always sabotage myself when I'm on the verge of happiness.\n",
      "Twenty? Homer, I paid three hundred dollars for this just last year.\n",
      "I can't wait for the reviews!\n",
      "I know that. How much to fix it?\n",
      "I'M GOING TO THE OS-CARS! NOT AS A SEAT FILL-ER! I'LL GET A GIFT BAS-KET! BUT I WON'T DE-CLARE IT!\n",

      "That's what we've been trying to tell you.\n",
      "Especially when we send it to him piece by piece.\n",
      "I move we reconsider our club name. Make it something a little less blasphemous. After all we don't want to go to Hell.\n",
      "Aww, just like her mommy, Maggie Senior. So, what did everyone do today?\n",
      "Hmmm... the sea won't stand for this.\n",
      "Ayyyy! Ohhhh! Ayyyy! Ohhhh!\n",
      "That's not how a family vacation works. We do things together while your father has fun without us.\n",
      "How can we afford any of these private schools? They're all so expensive. If we want to throw good money after bad, why don't we just get Grampa that new pacemaker?\n",
      "Guess what, boy. Last night I towed your principal's car.\n",
      "I hope T-Rex likes the present I made him.\n",
      "Ohhh, that's a nice thought, Toddy, but to build an amusement park you need lots of money, and manpower, and turnstiles...\n",
      "What? She's hilarious.\n",
      "Hey, I'd rather live in a dump than in a world run by snooty garbage men.\n",
      "Now kids, instead of candy, I thought I'd serve an array of healthy fresh fruits.\n",
      "You didn't vote for anybody.\n",
      "The people of my tribe lived in harmony with the land.\n",
      "Look at Grampa and Selma frolicking in the water.\n",
      "You're glad? You don't look glad. Are you sure you know what glad means?\n",
      "I just know we're gonna be friends forever.\n",

      "Come on out, birdie! Follow the sound of my voice-voice-voice.\n",

      "Maarge. I think Bart's gone crazy!\n",
      "No.\n",
      "Everyone just act cool. If anyone asks, tell them we're plumbers... and then start plumbing until they go away.\n",
      "Son, let this be a lesson: never work hard and don't form emotional attachments. Also, don't be a cow.\n",
      "What are you lookin' at?\n",
      "He sure is -- if he can keep up with these party animals!\n",
      "Oh my. The room looks so bare.\n",

      "Um, can I be a mate on your ship? Preferably First Mate.\n",
      "Thanks, everyone. I'm all better now. No more storing up the anger 'til I explode. If any of you does something I don't like, you are gonna hear about it!\n",
      "Whatcha doing, Marge?\n",
      "Would you sign this for my wife Marge? She's a big fan and her birthday is tomorrow.\n",
      "You make us beg for a filthy pillow that a barnyard rat wouldn't curl up and die in! And watch pre-taped messages that make crashing look like fun!\n",
      "Marge, I... Damn it, where's that card?\n",
      "What, a wall?\n",
      "Homer, that's for children!\n",
      "Son, that's the stupidest idea I ever heard. And I know exactly who would pay top dollar for it.\n",
      "Where do you think you're going?\n",
      "Well, what can I do? They won't let me in the boys' school.\n",
      "Well, I'm going in anyway.\n",
      "Oh, it just turned up in the course of my daily rummaging. By the way, I oiled the hinge on your diary.\n",
      "Squibs!\n",
      "Don't just stare back at me, come up with a theory! Geez, it's all over the place. Holy Moly.\n",
      "Umm... no thanks.\n",

      "Bart, there's one left and it's mine!\n",
      "All right, the first thing they told me to do is make sure everyone here is in the right class.\n",

      "Make it snappy, Milhouse. I've got an important meeting in the teachers' lounge.\n",
      "I cheated!\n",
      "All right, then. Uh, how about this?\n",
      "Awww...\n",
      "Ooh, that's a great idea.\n",
      "You know, Mom and Dad are almost forty, and Bart is ten. That means you didn't have him until way after high school.\n",
      "No, no, just give them each a nickel and send them to Moe's. Let them while away the afternoon spilling their beer on gullets and trousers whilst drooling over French postcards.\n",

      "Empty my pockets you say? Well, certainly, but I fail to see how...\n",
      "Marge, flying in private jets is great and all, but it's just too dangerous. That's why I've decided to go to the plant and beg Mr. Burns for my old job back.\n",

      "When he opens the door...\n",

      "What was it? 50-60 thousand dollars? ... Moe? Look, maybe it would help if you went over all the mistakes you made from the beginning... Moe?\n",

      "Sorry, sorry.\n",
      "At some point I think we should see a doctor.\n",
      "Marge, sweetie, I'm not gonna lie. I must have tied one on at Moe's. If you have it in your heart, could you forgive me and totally blame my friends?\n",
      "You know it's the darndest thing -- women love you when you've dated a movie star.\n",
      "You're right!\n",
      "Focused...\n",

      "What is this crap? Are you wearing a wire?\n",
      "CRIE? What does that stand for?\n",
      "Oh, my little guy's out there in the hot sun without his sombrero.\n",
      "Who told? Marge! Beer me!\n",
      "Oh, that's great.\n",

      "Oh man, this is so confusing.\n",

      "Nothing yet. But the time draws near. Now, let's get those fillings out of you.\n",
      "Sorry! No cash for Neddie! Homer keep all money! Bye bye Neddie! Bye bye!\n",
      "People, people. Space monsters. This is going nowhere. There's only one man who can settle an argument this bizarre.\n",
      "Gimme a break, will ya? It's a friggin' saga.\n",
      "Wasn't me.\n",
      "Bart, son. You wanna play catch?\n",

      "Does this mean you and Dad might get a D-A-V-U-R-S?\n",
      "Thank you for applying to the Ovenfresh Bakeoff. Every year many wonderful cooks fail to qualify.\n",
      "Seriously, I'm gonna make you proud. I have hidden talents.\n",
      "Hey, are you callin' my life-partner a sissy? 'Cause a hundred bucks says he could whup you in arm wrestling.\n",
      "Without. Let me go!\n",
      "C'mon, Santa's Little Helper! I'm sorry I ever let you go! Pick me! Please pick me!\n",
      "Hey, Homer. Here's a bloopie for ya.\n",
      "Well, at least you can't nag me anymore.\n",

      "Well, I guess it's impossible to control all the media -- unless of course, you're Rupert Murdoch. He is one beautiful man.\n",
      "This is my fault. I tried to teach Bart about town pride, but the power of my words filled him with a sort of madness.\n",
      "Really?\n",
      "Easy there, habitrail.\n",
      "Gimme one of those!\n",
      "Pass.\n",
      "Don't worry. We'll catch him, or run him over tryin'.\n",

      "Marge what're you doing? It's lunch time.\n",
      "Isn't there anything you can do?\n",
      "Or that we made a few adjustments to the soda machine...\n",
      "Sweetie, you seem so blue. Did the last of something die?\n",
      "Wow. It's like Marge's dream come true... for me! Isn't that great, Marge?! For me!\n",

      "The Wind in the Willows.\n",
      "I wonder why Bart and Lisa are so late getting home from school?\n",
      "Oh hey, how's it goin' there, Mr. Murdoch?\n",
      "You traded our mattress? I had my secret cash in it!\n",
      "This makes me feel special, Dad. Since I'm the one you kept, that must mean you really love me.\n",
      "Yeah, right.\n",
      "Thanks, Bart.\n",
      "I suppose I better. Your father's a very private person.\n",
      "Execute the cameraman!\n",
      "Good news, honey. I found a way to prove to the town we're not losers. I've entered us in a doubles tournament.\n",
      "We love the Leader!\n",
      "You mean like will apes be our masters?\n",
      "That doesn't seem fair -- they won't let him escape, then they kick him out. I wonder where he'll go.\n",
      "Well, nobody loves his kids more than me!\n",
      "Yeah, it's great that she's got a father-figure in her life. She--hey wait, that's supposed to be me!\n",

      "I suppose if he'd been able to do it that week, we might have given him the five dollars.\n",
      "It certainly has enriched our lives.\n",
      "This is perfect! If I know Fat Tony, which I don't, he'll be distracted by his hosting duties. Come on.\n",

      "You've certainly taken a shine to that magazine.\n",
      "Bart, we're too worried to enjoy each other's mouths.\n",
      "According to Eternity Magazine you can lose weight through subliminal learning. That's where an idea is subtly implanted in your head without you even knowing it.\n",
      "Okay, here we go.\n",
      "Hm. Where in the hell is that soothing music coming from?\n",
      "Ooh, Maggie made some new friends.\n",

      "They're fine.\n",
      "Are we gonna do any actual math problems?\n",
      "Rod, you order anything you want for your big ten-oh.\n",
      "Listen, Ned Flanders murdered his wife.\n",
      "The kids were supposed to be keeping this yard clean.\n",
      "No it isn't -- it's a lump of slush! Look at it!\n",
      "Point one oh with a stomach full of bread. My final offer.\n",
      "Well, I-I... let's just rent a movie.\n",
      "Uh, you can pick him up tomorrow.\n",

      "Are you boys through playing war?\n",
      "Well, Maggie weighs a lot less than... oh, I'll just go.\n",

      "Well, as the tree said to the lumberjack -- I'm stumped.\n",
      "We know, Dad. We were there.\n",

      "Clear!\n",
      "Joan, give me your dessert.\n",
      "Ohhh, it sounds so real!\n",
      "The box says it's the perfect way to spend a day. And why would a box lie to a person?\n",

      "Are you saying my money's all gone?!\n",
      "You know, alarm code three six seven nine. Three six seven nine!\n",
      "What!? What would help!?\n",
      "So... is that standing water?\n",
      "And we're here to tell you that your movies have lost their way.\n",
      "No! Well, ten beers...\n",
      "Little help?\n",
      "Is that the radon detector?\n",
      "Me using funny modes of transportation like a hot air balloon and a camel, and finally a pickup truck full of chickens? Then I get out of the truck and go thank the driver, but then I see the driver is a chicken?\n",

      "I love you, Smithers.\n",
      "Chew, chew, chew! Swallow, swallow, swallow!\n",
      "Uh, you look pretty clean. You, uh, mind if I had this dance?\n",
      "Now Marge, when our little girl's happiness is at stake...\n",

      "I am Rudy Giuliani. Do as I command you. I am Rudy Giuliani. Do as I command you.\n",
      "What's so good about it....\n",
      "Great, another job lost to a foreigner.\n",
      "I learned from the master.\n",
      "Nothing beats a weapon made of weapons!\n",
      "Uh, well, he seemed like a loner... kept to himself, mostly.\n",
      "No problem-o.\n",
      "Well, if you don't know the right path to take, you have to be very quiet and listen for that little voice inside that tells you what to do.\n",
      "No, no. I'm just a kid. Leave me alone!\n",
      "Wow, I must have really tied one on last night.\n",
      "Oh.\n",
      "Oh, I just got comfortable. Use the bottle.\n",
      "Why don't you kids come trick-or-treating with Maggie and me?\n",
      "Tanks? Oh, this is just too inaccurate.\n",
      "Try the Flan De Leche De Cabra...\n",
      "Thank you.\n",
      "You know, I feel pretty good. Maybe I should just keep walking instead of going into a dark, dreary bar.\n",
      "Who are you?!\n",
      "Dad, I know we don't normally talk about this stuff, but there's this girl at school I kind of like.\n",
      "Yeah, well, yeah, well see who's got it now.\n",
      "With Norman Fell as Zeus!\n",

      "Hey, if it moves, you can bet on it.\n",
      "Amen.\n",
      "That is disgusting.\n",
      "Nooo!!\n",
      "Look, the important thing is that we all learned a lesson. These guys learned the richness and variety of the world outside college.\n",
      "Most entertaining, but how does that help me?\n",
      "Dirksen, tuck in your shirt. Jaffee, spit out that gum.\n",
      "But they're ours! You stole them from us!\n",
      "Now! As an attack dog, you'll be expected to neutralize intruders.\n",
      "Willie! As your employer, I insist that you...\n",
      "No. It went just as we planned, except they confiscated my thermos of cola at the door.\n",
      "Oh, I love this song.\n",
      "I thought you were retiring. Why are you still here?\n",
      "Oh, the popular singer slash songwriter slash puzzle piece.\n",

      "Flanders, I said I didn't -- Tomorrow? Sure, what the hey. I'd love to come to your barbecue. I'll even bring the thickest, juiciest T-bones you've ever seen.\n",
      "I'm telling you people the earth revolves around the sun.\n",
      "Well, Mel, they're swell.\n",
      "He's right, ya know.\n",

      "Dad, I could actually win this thing!\n",
      "But this isn't like a loan application or a will -- you signed away my dignity. And I'm going to get it back. Lisa, do I have my pants on?\n",
      "Why are we having dinner in Shelbyville?\n",
      "Eh, that's no help.\n",
      "Marge, I'm pullin' an all-nighter for my little girl. Put on a pot of coffee, drink it and start makin' burgers.\n",
      "Oh, Homer, where have you been?\n",
      "Aw, recycling is useless, Lis. Once the sun burns out, this planet is doomed. You're just making sure we spend our last days using inferior products.\n",

      "I'm sorry, Officer. I know I was going too fast. Just give me a ticket.\n",
      "See, Lisa? Instead of one Big Shot controlling all the media, now there's a thousand freaks Xeroxing their worthless opinions.\n",
      "And you Marge, the bringer of beer!\n",
      "We sure are far from the rest of 'em. Funny how that happened, huh?\n",
      "Mrs. Krabappel, I didn't...\n",

      "Damn right. Bart, you can't go to see that Itchy & Scratchy movie. Ever!\n",
      "Uh, no. Not yet. He still lives at the train yard. But he's a hungry young fighter. In fact, he's actually fighting for a sandwich.\n",
      "There's the gap!\n",
      "What do you mean?\n",
      "What's he doing here?\n",

      "Anyhoo, I'm about to share with you a modern-day miracle. Something that has revitalized cities from East St. Louis to Biloxi, Mississippi. The magic medicine of... casino gambling!\n",

      "Wow. So that's how Lisa got her sax.\n",
      "Really? Well, I did bring this envelope full of money.\n",
      "Yeah, just a little shocked. What's that? Some kinda sorting machine?\n",
      "Piece o' cake. Now where's that kid with my latte?\n",
      "What can I say? It hasn't been easy staying in my rut...\n",
      "Okay Homer, don't panic. Let me do the talking.\n",
      "Oh, my little girl says the cutest things.\n",
      "Except for the face full of glass when the door finally collapsed, he did a pretty good job.\n",

      "Why don't you come stay with us till you can get back on your feet?\n",
      "Hey Dad, why don't we watch you drink from a hose?\n",
      "You're right. It's time to rebuild my self-esteem.\n",
      "Kids? Kids?\n",
      "So Marge wasn't cheating on me, I never hit her, and my family is throwing me an awesome party. Thank God I figured it out before I did anything stupid.\n",
      "What? There's nothing to worry about.\n",
      "Okay, that didn't work. This time move your head and don't follow through.\n",

      "Tell that to the good men who just lost their lives.\n",
      "They're making monkeys smoke cigarettes...\n",
      "Marge, let me set your mind straight about something -- that spectacular young couple is definitely better for the kids. But those kids are ours, because we made them, by accident. And now, we're gonna take them back because we love them, especially now that we've had a little time apart from them.\n",
      "Wait Marge, I don't want you to leave the house without this.\n",
      "All right, I'm comin'.\n",
      "That's a great story, Lisa! And you should stop reading right there.\n",

      "AND YOU LIKE POTATO...\n",
      "Cymbals... snare... high hat... tom-tom... sticks, mallet and brushes... this is a drum kit!\n",
      "Dad, I don't want to enter the tournament just to hurt Mom.\n",
      "Ptew!! Ptew!! I'm telling Mom and Dad.\n",
      "Time to show them the new me. No one's happier and more well-adjusted than a standup comedian.\n",
      "I need that money. Please, please...\n",
      "Oh that. It's just a birth mark and I'll thank you not to stare.\n",
      "I don't see what that has to do with Groundskeeper Willie.\n",
      "Yeah. Big deal. You got a wife. I got a rash. Who cares? Ech, I'm sorry, Homer. It's just, it's been four years since my last date with a whatchacallit, uh, woman.\n",
      "Welcome, neighbors... since the police can't seem to get off their dufferoonies to do something about this burglarino, I think it's time we start our own neighborhood watch... arooni!\n",
      "Come on, guys. We can't play without Bart. He's the heart of this team!\n",
      "Ah, big deal. Who needs his money? We're gettin' by okay.\n",
      "Ow!\n",
      "Maybe we could bury the rocket ship inside the cake. And that would be a big surprise because I'd forget about it pretty quick.\n",
      "Dad, would you like some of my Snicker-bar cheesecake?\n",
      "Yeah, his hairdo looks so queer.\n",
      "Why you little... I'll endanger you!\n",
      "Oh, c'mon, Edna. We both know these children have no future.\n",
      "Can I?\n",
      "Oh fine.\n",
      "Clear the couch. It's Krusty time!\n",
      "What are you doing here, Patty-or-Selma?\n",
      "Lou! Where are you, little buddy?\n",
      "Arrrgh!\n",
      "Check out those non-skybox losers, watching hockey without sushi. If you can call that hockey.\n",
      "So Marge, in tomorrow's game I'm gonna recover a fumble just for you.\n",
      "What? Are you sure?\n",
      "That's better.\n",
      "You should have asked first, Bart. Weddings are hard work and cost thousands of dollars.\n",
      "Eyes bigger than your stomach, eh, wolfie?\n",
      "Hey boy, check out my new car!\n",
      "Tire fire.\n",
      "Arewethereyet Arewethereyet Arewethereyet?\n",
      "Hey, that time she looked right at me and didn't touch me.\n",
      "Right...\n",
      "Well, Burns isn't gettin' this back cheap, I'll tell you that. He's going to have to give me... my own recording studio.\n",
      "That's a hard hat zone!\n",
      "Not if I can help it! C'mere, beams! Come on! Hey, hey, where you going? Oh, there's too many!\n",
      "I didn't say stop.\n",
      "Oo, look, it's Maggie!\n",
      "I can't. The beans'll burn.\n",
      "Worse.\n",
      "Sorry, I've got a baseball game in fifteen minutes.\n",
      "Look everybody! I'm the same person I always was.\n",
      "Dad, we'd love to stay here and listen to your amusing antidotes, but we have to take these coins to the mall and spend them.\n",
      "Losers...\n",
      "You think I can't kill you? There's a hundred little punks graduating from Syracuse this year that would beg to kiss my ass! Get outta here!\n",
      "When the time comes, we won't be in our homes...because we're all gonna go here.\n",
      "No problem.\n",
      "I've got to tell Homer about this baby in just the right way and at just the right time. Until then please, keep this to yourselves.\n",
      "Okay, let me get this straight -- you got all this moolah, legitimately, but you're too scared to do anything fun with it?\n",
      "This is no accident.\n",
      "Yes, well, I have ten high-priced lawyers.\n",
      "Homer!\n",
      "Look, you're Milhouse.\n",
      "Oh Dad, I missed you so much.\n",
      "...and that's why you're acting so sweet and kind. Because Dad drugged you!\n",
      "Mom, this is great! It makes our real house look like a pile of crap.\n",
      "Although it was suspiciously pro-lawnmower.\n",
      "She does not want to... turn out like... you... didn't... not until... diplomatic... trapped... help... remember nothing!\n",
      "Kids. Kids... I'm not gonna die. That only happens to bad people.\n",
      "Hel-lo.\n",
      "Honey, I'm home!\n",
      "Your Daddy hit the referee.\n",
      "Hello.\n",
      "Yes! Your queen is back!\n",
      "It's called remorse, you vile burlesque of irrepressible youth.\n",
      "Bart, if there's one thing I'm good at, it's pretending things didn't happen. And I think this is one of those.\n",
      "Dentist?! You said we were going to ride dirt bikes around the cemetery!\n",
      "Back off, you unholy dreamboat!\n",
      "I'm sick of your lies. Secrets and lies. It's always secrets and lies.\n",
      "Bo-ring. I'll take you to a place that's really romantic.\n",
      "Keep talkin'.\n",
      "See that hippo rolling in dung? You're the dung.\n",

      "Gad Zooks!\n",
      "I wasn't joking.\n",
      "Woo hoo!\n",

      "Well, last night, I had a visit from three spirits...\n",
      "Oh, Lisa's still mad at me.\n",
      "Uh, shouldn't you put on a batting helmet?\n",
      "Wow, you sure get a lot of balls for a quarter.\n",
      "Mr. Burns, if you want people to do a good job, you can't bully them. You have to show them they're appreciated.\n",
      "Yeah, yeah.\n",
      "Thanks Flanders. I have to agree that everything certainly... huh?\n",
      "Oh, what's the big deal? Bart didn't like his presents. So what? It's not like he gives us such great gifts. Remember that maple leaf ironed between the sheets of wax paper? What was that? That was crap.\n",
      "Real.\n",
      "Hey, I'm flexible! You don't have to pay all at once. I'll be here all night if you change your mind.\n",
      "Why do I ever put you in charge of the littlest thing?\n",
      "Smithers! Trading me in for a younger model, I see.\n",
      "Don't worry, Marge.\n",
      "SHINER BE GONE.\n",
      "Maybe I should tell Skinner that it was our...\n",

      "Hello, is this H. Powell of Detroit, Michigan?\n",
      "Hey!\n",
      "Which one?\n",
      "I'm gonna sleep down here tonight.\n",

      "And I'm taking all the exciting colors out of your crayons!\n",
      "Oh.\n",
      "Will you duel, or are you a coward?!\n",
      "So, Milhouse, it must be a little tough givin' up all that glamour comin' back to school, huh.\n",
      "My husband's going to jail and it's all your fault! Do you know why no one likes you?\n",
      "Ow, ow! Oh, real mature, Lenny.\n",
      "Y'ello.\n",
      "Stay back or I'll boot your Prime Minister! I'll do it! So help me God I'll boot him!\n",
      "I guess we're not going to find anyone.\n",
      "Yeah... Where are my pants?\n",
      "Tonight let's all draw pictures of what your father just said.\n",
      "Oh, Smithers, I guess there's nothing left but to kiss my sorry butt good-bye!\n",
      "She'll see through me like Grandma's underpants.\n",
      "Ham?\n",
      "The guards are sadistic and cruel!\n",
      "Is there any way to get out of this?\n",
      "Oh Marge, you gotta get on the net. It's got all the best conspiracy theories. Did you know that Hezbollah owns Little Dolly Snack Cakes? This stuff will rock your world.\n",
      "Oh, get off your soapbox, Simpson! Do you realize how much it costs to run for office? More than any honest man can afford.\n",
      "Oh, I so believe that.\n",
      "Well here's another low-rated annual event -- Spring Cleaning!\n",
      "Not bad.\n",
      "I told him that photo would come back to haunt him.\n",
      "One more crack out of you, young man, and I'm showing everyone your baby pictures.\n",
      "Now remember, we have to leave nature just the way we found it. Everything we pack in, we pack out.\n",
      "Parenting. It's the one job you always know you're doing right.\n",
      "Stop right there.\n",
      "You look terrible.\n",
      "Does anyone have any swan heads? I've got nothing but necks.\n",
      "I'm very concerned. Mr. Burns has stolen our son and he won't give him back.\n",
      "Yuh-huh.\n",
      "There's no ring on that finger.\n",
      "I love watching you knit. It reminds me of watching pictures download on our old dial-up modem. Remember that day we brought it home and it was all eee, ooo, eee, ooo, onnnggg!\n",
      "Rock stars. Is there anything they don't know?\n",

      "Well, maybe it's, uh, uh... a Neanderthal, who got bitten by some angry fish.\n",
      "I'm just whistlin', man.\n",
      "Hey, can I have some turkey?\n",
      "You're all idiots. I'm putting it on Chill Thunder Lite.\n",
      "I don't know, but it is.\n",
      "Aww. Innocent babies whistling nonchalantly. How sweet. Maggie will be back to play with you tomorrow.\n",
      "Robots... trying to kill me... and now they'll kill you... 'cause I led them here...\n",
      "Hel-lo.\n",
      "Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. This movie's turning into Sponge Bob No-Pants!\n",
      "Of how much fun I am to be around! It's always a party with Fun Dad!\n",
      "I was wrong about you buying that truck. I'm very proud of you, Mr. Plow. .\n",
      "This better work, boy. I don't wanna wind up workin' on your mother's emu farm.\n",
      "Marge, it happened again!\n",
      "Fine. I'll call three numbers. What are they?\n",
      "Bart, I told you not to get your lip disked.\n",
      "Okay, who's ready for a wedding-theme knock-knock joke?\n",
      "I saved your career, man! Remember your comeback special?\n",
      "Yes!\n",
      "Going somewhere?\n",
      "Huh? Why not?\n",
      "Grab onto this! C'mon, wake up!\n",
      "Principal Skinner, as we both know, but you might need reminding, the annual bake sale provides ninety percent of the school's funding.\n",
      "Well, they would keep me company. And this pickle you're offering only sweetens the deal.\n",
      "Am I the only one here who's in horrible pain?\n",
      "Simpson! I need a ride to the library.\n",
      "Okay, Lis. Turn on the waterworks, babe.\n",
      "Mom, I'd love to. But to be honest, I don't need new clothes.\n",
      "Homer, can I see you in the kitchen?\n",
      "I won't be insured until three o'clock?! Okay, until then, I have to avoid any serious injuries or accidents on my property, or I'm ruined.\n",
      "Let me freshen that up for ya.\n",
      "You sure you're not just doing all this because it's cool to be accepting of a gay family member?\n",
      "Hi, Mom. Hi, Dad.\n",
      "Did they jump on the pile to smoosh it down?\n",
      "I'm using non-violent resistance.\n",

      "I have hair!... I have hair!\n",
      "Do it!\n",
      "You were right about watching him fly.\n",
      "It's your fault! I accidentally laughed at your immature prank.\n",
      "Hey Moe, you got any cough syrup?\n",
      "I don't know. It came with the house.\n",
      "Well, there's bound to be some splashback.\n",
      "Soyghetti-O's!\n",
      "Those were idealistic days... The candidacy of John Anderson, the rise of Supertramp... It was an exciting time to be young!\n",
      "Enough of this vulgarity. Back to your brothel, harlots!\n",
      "Uh, gentlemen... I'm uh... I'm starting to wonder if we've crossed a line here.\n",
      "Oh, aren't you sweet? Sharing your allowance with a poor Brazilian boy.\n",
      "You ate the food and looked in the mirrors! They're staying.\n",

      "You know, I was just wondering how someone who works in an ice cream store keeps such a trim figure.\n",
      "Starting tomorrow, I'm a nuclear technician!\n",
      "The thing is no one was hurt. I think it would be really silly to dwell on this.\n",

      "He's crazy!\n",
      "Go back to Massachusetts, pinko!\n",

      "Hm. Does Dad seem a little... dumber than usual?\n",
      "Marge, the Rapture is nigh. These books will help me figure out how nigh.\n",

      "Eh.\n",
      "All right, I'm gonna let you guys in on something. But you've got to keep it much more secret than I did.\n",
      "Mom, stop! According to this, it says Bart mixed up his DNA with a fly's. I think that's Bart!\n",
      "I'm gonna miss you, son. And listen... while you're seeing all those great sights, always remember that you're representing your country. I guess what I'm saying is, don't mess up France the way you messed up your room.\n",
      "Even the Pope couldn't forgive this pizza... and he's letting a lot of things slide these days.\n",
      "Heya, guys.\n",
      "May I escort you to the railing?\n",
      "Gaaah!\n",
      "Well, I am glad you're spending more time with us, but maybe you should get a plumber to help you with that.\n",
      "It's better to be safe than sorry. Sorry.\n",
      "Hmm, maybe I could be an expert on dinosaurs.\n",
      "I think we need a new hairdryer.\n",

      "Good idea, Marge. By the way, this Friday night I'm gonna be attending a little get-together with the boys at work. Eugene Fisk is marrying some girl in Valve Maintenance.\n",

      "That sounds fine, Bart.\n",
      "I'm Mr. X! Gimme! Gimme!\n",
      "Sharing is a bunch of bull too. And helping others. And what's all this crap I've been hearing about tolerance?\n",
      "I'm so sick of hearing about that stupid, unreliable Ray! Who, by the way, I've never even met!\n",
      "U.S. OF A! Great song, Ted. When's our next gig? Are we goin' to New York, or--\n",
      "Will that hold up in court?\n",
      "Okay kids, stay together!\n",
      "Homer! That necklace was a priceless Bouvier family heirloom.\n",
      "Helmet? That's Springfield talk.\n",
      "Well, if I'm gonna start a diet, this is my last chance to eat all the crap I love.\n",
      "I think I'm gonna be sick.\n",
      "What about this swordfish?\n",
      "Excellent. Set you to your task, Simpson.\n",
      "You're right, I'm sorry. Tell you what: Saturday night we'll go out for steaks, just you and me.\n",
      "Bart, they lied to us. Instead of giving us an education, they tricked us into designing a toy. Aren't you outraged?\n",
      "Well, how about Louie?\n",
      "Who's using the power tools?\n",
      "Wow! Wow!!! WOW!!!\n",
      "Oh fine. We're putting in an on-board something-or-other and rack-and-peanut steering...\n",
      "... ...\n",
      "What are you dopes lookin' at? You've never seen bling-bling before?\n",
      "I had a little left between my toes. It quickly multiplied, and now I'm a bigger bastard than ever. But I must know -- what was it about me that made you try?\n",
      "I don't think this was a great place to bring the children.\n",
      "The one with the amulet?\n",
      "Lisa, wake up! They're taking Angelica to Mount Purgatorium.\n",
      "Thank you, sir. And what more fitting finale than to gaze reverently at Old Glory.\n",
      "And a spring for his curly tail! Huh-huh. Oink, oink, oink...Huh-huh!\n",
      "Yes sir! This is a real adventure. Why, I bet there are people who would trade everything they have in the world for an adventure like this.\n",
      "Bart, don't tell your mother, but I brought you some pizza.\n",
      "Do you want turkey sausage or ham?\n",
      "Don't wanna come out.\n",
      "Congratulations! I dub thee King of the Morons, also known as Supervisor for Sector Seven-G. Here is your key to the executive washroom.\n",
      "Why do you say that?\n",
      "A cougar! Die, cougar!\n",

      "Um-hmm.\n",
      "Oooh. Pizza.\n",
      "I think he forgot, Mom.\n",
      "How does he do it, Smithers?\n",
      "Hmm. This isn't nearly as complicated as Moe made it seem.\n",
      "A whole week of just father and son! See you at dinner.\n",
      "Actually, it wasn't me. It was my Dad, Grampa.\n",
      "That's odd. He's outside, digging.\n",
      "I know exactly who I am. I am the sister of a rotten, jealous, mean little sneak.\n",
      "A boyfriend...\n",
      "Were we ever that stupid?\n",
      "Mom, I have to do this! I love that big ol' cow!\n",
      "Thanks, Milhouse. We make a great team.\n",
      "I've got something for you.\n",
      "Oh, it ain't no mystery -- whole modern world got a swishifyin' effect on kids today. And their MTV's and their diet sodas ain't gonna set 'em straight neither. You gotta do it yourself, Homer. And you gotta do it fast.\n",
      "The lady said no.\n",
      "Hurry, Dad, hurry!\n",
      "'STEAD OF THE STUFF WE'VE GOT...\n",
      "Uh, yeahhh! Thanks, Mom.\n",
      "Oops! That's for me. Flancrest Enterprises is my home business.\n",

      "A ghost train! And so little time to get out of the way!... Now less!... Now none!\n",
      "But Mom... tomorrow's the big donkey basketball game.\n",
      "At least no one else has taken this drug.\n",
      "Doreen? She's cheated on you with everyone -- well, except for me. And I've showered her with gifts! Fancy soaps and massage oils and uh... what have ya...\n",
      "I'm really sorry about what I did, Allison. It's no shame being second to you.\n",
      "Hey, c'mon! Those are prescription shoes! I need them!\n",
      "Manjula, come quick! The octuplets said their first words.\n",

      "I need some supplies: a keg of beer, and a six-pack to hold me till I tap the keg.\n",
      "Yo.\n",
      "Stop the tour!\n",
      "Nooo!\n",
      "What is it, sweetie?\n",
      "Milhouse?!\n",
      "Heh, no kidding, I saw your reviews.\n",
      "Oh great, we came all this way and it's the wrong guy.\n",
      "Oooh... how'd they get there?\n",
      "Darn right. And to make sure, I want to be stuffed and put on the couch as a constant reminder of our marital vows.\n",
      "Homer, how much did you just give that man?\n",
      "Ice cream at church? I'm intrigued, yet suspicious.\n",
      "Oh, honey, I can't right now. Bart's gonna be late!\n",
      "Where'd they go?\n",
      "Noooo!\n",
      "Well, that's better than me. But still, you've gotta get out.\n",
      "That's not true, Lisa, there are a lot of complicated issues here, that can only be explained through song.\n",
      "Who was that?\n",
      "Negatively, I assume.\n",
      "Ned!\n",
      "That's right. I lost my job so that you could have another 100 million dollars.\n",
      "Lesson over.\n",
      "Oh... Where are you?\n",
      "No disrespect, fat man, but you'd better poop out a dirt bike.\n",
      "I like it in the cage. These cedar shavings are a helluva lot better than my lumpy mattress.\n",
      "You wasted our money on something extravagant for yourself!\n",
      "Look at me. I've never been so angry. My hands are shaking.\n",
      "I'm sorry, honey. Can't we just forget it and go to church.\n",
      "Uh... all of them. They're having a party. Jimmy Carter's passed out on the couch.\n",
      "It's our last family dinner for six weeks, but I promised myself I wouldn't cry.\n",
      "Homer, you can't just reroute the gas line. Do you know how dangerous that is?\n",
      "Well, you can't possibly like Maggie best. What has she ever done? Nothin' for nobody!\n",
      "Bor-ing!\n",
      "Mom, do something!\n",
      "Uh, I'm not sure she's workin' out.\n",
      "Marge, I hate to interrupt the ol' solilo-diddly-iloquy, but I just want to thank you for your early Christmas card.\n",
      "Good morning, Moe's Tavern!\n",
      "Wait, wait, wait. You're putting us in a new school?! What about my friends?\n",
      "Oh, you look great.\n",
      "Wait, you don't want me to have this cat!\n",
      "The jewel will lead me to my baby sister? Why are you telling me this?\n",
      "Arrrgh!\n",
      "I'll be fine, dear.\n",
      "So do you get satellite radio cheaper in space?\n",
      "Okay, the key to this thing is the manatees. Is Marge saving them or killing them?\n",

      "Homer, I've got a fozzie of a bear of a problem. Y'know, Maude and her mother were visiting Tyre and Sidon, the twin cities of the Holy Land. They must've kneeled in the wrong place and prayed to the wrong God, because, well, they're being held prisoner by militants of some sort.\n",
      "Well, guess I might as well head back to my store. I've got a date with some twins: my state and federal tax forms.\n",

      "Too late!\n",
      "This is our house. There's nothing buried here but hopes and dreams!\n",
      "Listen, I'm real sorry I busted your shack. Let me make it up to you. I know a ravine where there's a rusted-out car.\n",
      "Griddler on the Roof? Thank God It's Fried Eggs? Luftwaffle's?\n",
      "I have a solution!\n",
      "What did I do to deserve this?\n",
      "Lou, if that plane leaves the ground and you're not on it, you'll regret it. Maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow, but soon, and definitely after they kill you and make you into sloppy Joes.\n",

      "What would have happened if there was someone who could break us up every time I had my doubts about you?\n",
      "Dessert is three desserts.\n",

      "No! I want to help the people who didn't prepare!\n",
      "No!\n",

      "Apes... deep down we're all savage apes. Leave your body, Homer.\n",
      "You planted that on me, man!\n",
      "Well I'll make these rioters regret their folly. This prison will make Abu Ghraib look like the Four Seasons. Smithers, we'll need electrical wire, a hood and someone who can really point at genitalia.\n",

      "There's my hundred -- where's my party?\n",
      "Okay, we can trace where the kids are by the charges they made on your card. In Colorado, they charged two hundred dollars worth of bubble gum.\n",

      "Grazie, Springfield!\n",
      "And since we're returning your second born, do you think you could see your way to returning my TV tr...\n",
      "I could say it's the being shot at or the flat, emotionless way you talk or the fact that PayPal was my idea and I was just about to do it when you came out with it... but really it's that this town isn't ready for you, and neither am I.\n",
      "But I haven't earned his trust if it's based on a lie.\n",

      "Must... squeeze... harder!\n",
      "Homie, I'm glad you're passionate, I just hope you're not riling people up with your show.\n",
      "Well, we're not the only ones to be unjustly imprisoned. Check out all the left-wing celebrities.\n",
      "Yo, Grampa! Time for the awards.\n",
      "It's all my fault. I should never have listened to those KISS albums when I was pregnant.\n",
      "Oh, here, let me help you.\n",
      "It's not funny, Bart! Millions of girls will grow up thinking that this is the right way to act! That they can never be anything more than vacuous ninnies whose only goal is to look pretty, land a rich husband, and spend all day on the phone with their equally vacuous friends talking about how damn terrific it is to look pretty and have a rich husband!!\n",
      "That nerds conduct electricity.\n",
      "That freeloading fatso! Marge, could you cut back on your makeup budget?\n",
      "Our first anniversary.\n",
      "So I guess the lesson here is...\n",
      "Ooh, let's go to the waterpark. My ten-year ban ended yesterday.\n",
      "Patty! Selma! We're home.\n",
      "Bart, what famous historical figure do you want to write about?\n",
      "I'm on it.\n",
      "Then may I please rent it, please?\n",
      "Awww. / Oh, no.\n",
      "And what color would that be?\n",
      "Time to reap the benefits of being cool.\n",
      "You should hang with us sometime, Lis.\n",
      "Frightened, Bart? Welcome to Stage Three: Fear.\n",
      "Maybe I was a little hard on him, expecting him to be Larry right away. By the way, where is Larry?\n",
      "Dad, we have to do something -- all the bees are dying!\n",
      "That's our girl.\n",
      "Okay, comforting, comforting... Uh Dad, whenever I would hang out with Grandma, she would always ask me about you. And I'd say you suck, and she would say... you don't suck that bad.\n",
      "Duff please.\n",
      "Okilly dokilly.\n",
      "Oh, I'm sorry.\n",
      "Well, I'm not opening the door.\n",
      "No. We saw how much this cruise means to you, so we all sold something special. And we made just enough for an economy cabin!\n",
      "The light's on. All systems are ding-dong!\n",
      "Yes... well... get started.\n",
      "It does?\n",
      "/ Ow!\n",
      "Homer, please. I have to alter this suit so it looks different for tomorrow.\n",
      "Hi, Ralph.\n",
      "We're free! And we've got something to eat.\n",
      "Listen, you thugs, stop making fun of him or you'll be sorry!\n",
      "That's just the engine powering up. That's just the engine struggling.\n",
      "Chazz Busby says you're really making progress! Do you need more leg warmers?\n",
      "I can't neuter you, boy. Not after all we've been through.\n",
      "So get on the boat... the gravy boat.\n",
      "Thanks for the freedom of speech, dorks.\n",
      "Hey, you got rid of that goofy sacred elephant statue.\n",
      "We can't drive this up there. They'll see the dent. They'll see the coat hanger antenna. Stop the car. We're walking.\n",
      "Good grief, this candy's terrible.\n",
      "Marge, you're a tool of the dog house makers.\n",
      "Uh-oh.\n",
      "Hmm. That looks entertaining.\n",
      "Lisa Simpson!\n",
      "Hey, someone's boarded up our windows!\n",
      "There you are.\n",
      "Oh, oh, oh, I get it. You can't fire the players, so you fire the mascot. You make me sick.\n",
      "That's terrible!\n",
      "I'm outta here. Skinny, Krabby, catch ya later.\n",
      "Hey, c'mon, quit it.\n",
      "No way. We scored a free Hawaiian vacation.\n",
      "Hey Mom, can we have fried chicken for dinner?\n",
      "Twenty-two points. Plus triple word score. Plus fifty points for using all my letters. Game's over. I'm outta here.\n",
      "Anyway, I was growing to admire my professor more and more...\n",
      "Just quoting our twenty-sixth president, Lis. You could use a little T.R. in your life.\n",
      "Wow, Dad, you're really working hard.\n",
      "Ohhh, thank God. Thank God. Thank God.\n",
      "C'mon, son. Let's take the head thing back to the authorities.\n",
      "Could you give my wife a few lessons?\n",
      "For the next week I stayed alive by eating my mother's delicious preserves and maintained my sanity by dribbling a nearby basketball with my one free hand. I made a game of it, seeing how many times I could bounce the ball in a day, then trying to break that record. Occasionally the police arrived to search my home.\n",
      "No, I can't! I can't eat any of them!\n",
      "Lisa, you've got to learn that life isn't always fair. Try to channel your disappointment into something creative, like a sampler.\n",
      "To the mall! I'll explain on the way!\n",
      "Is it my hair? My overbite? The fact that I've worn the same clothes, day in, day out, for the last four years?\n",
      "You know, that's exactly what I --\n",
      "See, Abe, we're still visiting you, even though we have no biological obligation.\n",
      "How would you know? Your backhand looks like a rusty gate.\n",
      "I never used those pizza coupons.\n",
      "Oh... Oh... Ooo... Oh... Yodel.\n",
      "Well... I want to do the Christmas shopping this year.\n",
      "Finished?\n",
      "Easy... gentle...\n",
      "Oh, you're such a vigorous young go-getter. When's your next coffee break?\n",
      "Where do the people sit?\n",
      "Oh my.\n",
      "Almost everybody.\n",
      "So come to The Legless Frog... if you want to get sick and die, and leave a big, garlicky corpse. P.S. Parking was ample.\n",
      "We can find him faster by splitting up. You take fried foods. You take salty snacks. I'll take desserts. Break!\n",
      "I know how to save this park -- I'm gonna organize a charity carnival!\n",
      "You, there. Put your hands up.\n",
      "It wouldn't be the first time.\n",
      "False.\n",
      "Well, if we'd left at four A.M. like I wanted to...\n",
      "And we carried it out as a family!\n",
      "Hmmm.\n",
      "Praise be Oliver.\n",
      "Really? Sure.\n",
      "Nothing-head day!\n",
      "Actually, there are. Five, ten, fifteen, twenty... Uh, can you two share a hook?\n",
      "Don't worry, sweetie. With me at your side, our toast will do just what it's supposed to: steal focus from the bride.\n",
      "Thanks for making me feel better.\n",
      "Oh, that load of crap? No, I was just keepin' her busy while Nelson stole microscopes. Make with the story.\n",
      "Well, the folks at the senior center sure will love that peach tree we planted.\n",
      "Have any of your workers ever had their hands cut off by the machinery?\n",
      "Marge! Kids! You're alive!\n",
      "Come on, it's easy. Just push A, B, up, up, left trigger, right trigger, and both triggers at once.\n",
      "That longhair freak's bowled with us for years.\n",
      "Once again, cats have it better.\n",
      "I never complain about your frilly pillows.\n",
      "Please Dad.\n",
      "But seriously, we've had a lot of fun with our dad over the years.\n",
      "No, no, I didn't mean--\n",
      "Why did you shudder just now, Mom?\n",
      "Goodbye, Bart -- I like your sheets.\n",
      "Homercles cares not for beans.\n",
      "Let me get this straight. You're pleased with your current appearance? Ah, why my good man, you're the fattest thing I've ever seen. And I've been on safari.\n",
      "He's targeting the nuclear plant?!\n",
      "Leave us forever? I'd better pee on this fire.\n",
      "Oh, what do you think?\n",
      "Huh?\n",
      "Go pink! Come on, pink! / Come on, blue! Come on, come on, come on, take it, take it, there you go, yes!\n",
      "Sure, boy.\n",
      "Of course she did. Who else would have?\n",
      "Hello, I'm Mr. Plow. Are you tired of having your hands cut off by snow blowers, and the inevitable heart attacks that come with shoveling snow?\n",
      "So Willie, during the festival, you'll be wearing these urine-soaked rags. You're the village idiot!\n",
      "Oh, come on, I do plenty around here! Lisa never lifts a finger. Why don't you go yell at her?\n",
      "Hey, you're back. Did you rock the Casbah?\n",
      "I'll take him too!\n",
      "I love it when Mr. Burns shows a movie at work.\n",
      "I won't have cowards in my army.\n",
      "Gee, Homer, are you sure this is the right thing to do?\n",
      "Isn't it wonderful to have a hip female influence in the house?\n",
      "Why don't you guys take him. I thought he was the right dog for me, but I guess I made a mistake.\n",
      "Hey mom, can you pack me a dozen sandwiches in my lunch tomorrow? Meat, no meat, it's all good.\n",
      "Well, she couldn't indulge in strenuous activities like handball, but otherwise she was fine.\n",
      "Best six hundred bucks I ever spent. C'mon, boy. We've earned this Saturday, now let's make the most of it.\n",
      "Not now, honey. Daddy's busy.\n",
      "Ooh, your toaster takes bagels. How ritzy!\n",
      "Oh, no...\n",
      "Mmm, I suppose I could...\n",
      "How much do you want for it?\n",
      "Banned books?!\n",
      "What are you doing?\n",
      "Lumber. We need lumber.\n",
      "Mr. Estes, the publications advisor. I edited the whole thing.\n",
      "Patty, Selma, what a pleasant surprise.\n",
      "You know, Marge, this is just like when we were dating.\n",
      "Sorry we ruined your life, Homer.\n",
      "Bart?\n",
      "That's clever... and devastating. Stop the competition!\n",
      "I'm supposed to talk to you about Proposition 305...\n",
      "I do!\n",
      "Moe, I know things haven't been easy for you. But you're with people who love you in the most exciting of the twin cities.\n",
      "Bart!\n",
      "Uh, we're with them.\n",
      "You stupid nerds! He's trying to save you money on long distance!\n",
      "Over the sink! Over the sink!\n",
      "Big Daddy, would y'all mind passin' a li'l ol' biscuit?\n",
      "Real doctor or PhD?\n",
      "Uh, huh, that's Mr. Plow.\n",
      "Wait! We have to exchange insurance!\n",
      "Hey, we can be a team!\n",
      "Aw Dad, we'll miss you so much.\n",
      "How 'bout a Greg Norman Executive Putter from the Sky Mall?\n",
      "Ow! Oh, Bono! Help me!\n",
      "Finished. Now all we have to do is put our names on it.\n",
      "Hello, Marge. It's me. Homer.\n",
      "Thanks, Moe.\n",
      "Well... duh. You, Scioscia, sign up...\n",
      "Peace on Earth.\n",
      "But sweetie, I just wanted to tell the '74 Oakland A's how I felt about them.\n",
      "Ah, Little Vicki, I really think she had her heart set on...\n",
      "Ready... for... pick up. Ready! For! Pick up!\n",
      "Does not.\n",
      "But after some thought, all my worries went away.\n",
      "The telephone has been ringing for some time. Answer it.\n",
      "Say it Burns. Say I never shot you... Before.\n",
      "How did you know?\n",
      "It's your fault for giving birth to my arch-enemy!\n",
      "I think I'll go to bed.\n",
      "Good.\n",
      "You said you meant to make brownies. Any other lies?\n",
      "You're going to Stanford.\n",
      "Why did I agree to moderate this teleconference?\n",
      "The boss says you're fired.\n",
      "Come in. Come in. Don't wipe your feet.\n",
      "Sorry.\n",
      "Hey, it's the runt. I'll take anything but the runt.\n",
      "Really? You'll be my Cyrano?\n",
      "I think we should take him off the drug.\n",
      "I could have trained them to be my unholy army of the night. Go my pretties... kill, kill!\n",
      "Well, did you call one of your friends?\n",
      "Well, if you're not rich then how come you have a new refrigerator, an electric can opener, a milkshake machine...\n",
      "Quiet, honey, you don't know how big this government is. It goes all the way to the president.\n",
      "Well, bring him here now! I want my Homie back! I miss him and the things he did!\n",
      "Senior citizen? Flanders?\n",
      "Dad, we can't let this happen to Belle! Do something!\n",
      "No, no, no! That won't do at all!\n",
      "Homer, when did you become a member of P.E.T.A.?\n",
      "You crapped out, Vegas Mom.\n",
      "Hello, Mom? You won't believe what Bart's doing.\n",
      "Yes. Share with us the wisdom of the street, oh mighty Alcatraaaz.\n",
      "Oh, please, continue...\n",
      "Honey, I'm sorry. It's just that we have a hard enough time handling three kids.\n",
      "Homer!\n",
      "Just write down my findings as I give them to you. Six hours, nineteen minutes, right ascension, fourteen degrees, twenty-two minutes declination... No sighting.\n",
      "Creationism? But that's not science.\n",
      "Somebody ought to ruin Gabbo's career the way he ruined Krusty's.\n",
      "That's it, I'm writing a Christmas carol. If I can make my own clothes, I can do anything.\n",
      "Here, right?\n",
      "Hey, Barney, which one is Whirlwind?\n",
      "Not true. You've got the guts -- and I've got a web cam! This time you can tell the truth...\n",
      "My boy, you are a star!\n",
      "there, there's the ol' face-shredder!\n",
      "Well, you could punish me, but...\n",
      "...so, killing people together has really spiced things up in the bedroom.\n",
      "That's just a souvenir from an amusement park.\n",
      "We have a problem, Seymour.\n",
      "But he'll bring us joy, Marge. Unlike all your silly gewgaws.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "It was poisoned.\n",
      "Oh Death, you're a lifesaver!\n",
      "Rudy my man, you're a miracle worker.\n",
      "I don't know. I'm kind of dizzy. I should probably go home sick.\n",
      "Now you know what I've been goin' through.\n",
      "Wait! I've got an idea!\n",
      "Uh-oh.\n",
      "That's my final offer, take it or leave it.\n",
      "Your point being?\n",
      "Are these indiscretions romantic? Financial? Or Treasonous?\n",
      "Well, I will never forgive you, Bart.\n",
      "I, I, I tuned out. Where we goin'?\n",
      "Mom? Don't you think I could read the report by myself?\n",
      "I love spying.\n",
      "Take those silly things off.\n",
      "Sorry Lis, I can't be a vegetarian -- I love the taste of death! But please, help me get my cow back.\n",
      "Sometimes it's fun to use candles.\n",
      "Coooool.\n",
      "Well, I'd love to help you out, but you do have to be over eighteen.\n",
      "What?!\n",
      "Hey!\n",
      "Marge, the bathroom scale is lying again.\n",
      "Aren't you ready for church, Homer?\n",
      "And now for your triumphant walk down the runway.\n",
      "This is the greatest invention in the world! You'll make a million dollars!\n",
      "Hello Maggie... hello Maggie.\n",
      "Now, the tables have turned, haven't they?\n",
      "No, no, that's impossible. We reserved it months ago.\n",
      "Don't worry, Marge. As a favor to you, I'm enrolling that precious little jerk in this fresh air summer camp.\n",
      "Laser effects, mirrored balls. John Williams must be rolling around in his grave.\n",
      "Bart, no!\n",
      "Hey, Norman. How's it going? So you got dragged down here, too... heh, heh. How ya doing, Fred? Excuse me, Fred.\n",
      "Oh Lisa, if they're ever going to pull the plug on me, I want you in my corner, honey.\n",
      "Great joke, guys. Ha ha. Ha. Guys?\n",
      "Here you go, Monkey.\n",
      "Hello, Lisa. Help me bite crime. Ruff, ruff.\n",
      "Don't worry, this time I'm gonna write down where I parked.\n",
      "Okay, gotta focus, gotta focus, gotta look at that bird, gotta focus.\n",
      "But you'll kill both of us!\n",
      "No.\n",
      "Pan-thers!\n",
      "Huh, wha'? Oh, okay.\n",
      "Mmm... feed...\n",
      "How 'bout Tuborg? The beer of Danish Kings.\n",
      "Oh, my goodness! Look what's happened!\n",
      "I'm not sure my wife will go for these naughty mud flaps.\n",
      "I can't believe it. He covered your whole bed with wildflowers?\n",
      "All food tastes like barf now.\n",
      "What is your problem, boy?\n",
      "Lousy snitch.\n",
      "Well... if hiring this guy will make Lisa like me again, then I'll do it! Can I get this beer to go?\n",
      "But Dad, by striking they're trying to effect a change in management so that they can be happier and more productive.\n",
      "Awww.\n",
      "Son of a diddly!\n",
      "Uh-huh!\n",
      "Hey, hey, now you're talkin'!\n",
      "Wowww... That's good Squishee.\n",
      "Milhouse?\n",
      "So, can I deliver that to the office for you?\n",
      "NOW HERE'S A TIP FROM BLANCHE YOU WON'T REGRET...\n",
      "How can I fit my whole life into a suitcase? Maybe if I move that thing there... perfect.\n",
      "I'd better switch to the hard stuff.\n",
      "So, did all of your cars break down?\n",
      "Mr. Lincoln, my name is Lisa Simpson, and I have a problem.\n",
      "Are you playing poker with my college fund?\n",
      "Okay, uh-huh. Okay, okay,. Okay, okay, okay okay, it's done! I'm doing it! Birthday gift coming your way!\n",
      "939?! What the hell is that? Oh, my life is ruined.\n",
      "What a gyp.\n",
      "Run along, boy. You're free now!\n",
      "Why?\n",
      "Somebody wants mommy to change baby's diaper.\n",
      "Your boyhood dream was to eat the world's biggest hoagie. And you did it at the county fair last year. Remember?\n",
      "I'm not set at all.\n",
      "Asterisk! Asterisk! Asterisk!\n",
      "Okay, we're all locked up now...\n",
      "I'll return this to the school.\n",
      "You can supervise me.\n",
      "You made some good friends, didn't ya?\n",
      "Hey, why aren't you doing your homework!\n",
      "Oh great. Dad's dead.\n",
      "You know, if we were younger and crazier, we'd trade in these tickets and run off to Miami!\n",
      "Omigod! What'll I do? What'll I do?\n",
      "These are Bart's uncompleted homework assignments for the last month: worksheets, problem sets, book reports, math jumbles, dioramas, topic sentences, conclusions, bibliographies, synonyms, mean-the-sames, define-a-likes, word twins and one Thanksgiving hand-turkey.\n",
      "Uh-oh.\n",
      "But, but...\n",
      "Hey!\n",
      "Moe? What are you doing?\n",
      "Bob! You saved me! But how did you get the strength? Calder's work in this period was marked by heavy use of sheet metal painted to look deceptively airy.\n",
      "Shut up shut up shut up!\n",
      "I can't believe a mattress could make that much difference...\n",
      "What a wonderful night's sleep. Thank you methasorbizone tartrate, also known as Nappien.\n",
      "There you go, doll.\n",
      "Homer.\n",
      "Why don't you start a rumor that he's...ding-a-ling-a-ling hello-oo!\n",
      "I understand, honey. Did you get someone to cover?\n",
      "Doesn't ring a bell.\n",
      "The kidnappers say if you worry too much... they'll kill me.\n",
      "Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!\n",
      "And what about the tattoo on my you-know-what?\n",
      "Anyway, I love this hideous thing. Young lady, I'll take it!\n",
      "I learned too late that it implied tumescence.\n",
      "All right, Marge. I'll do it. For you.\n",
      "Oh no! Those were for Mr. Smithers' commitment ceremony!\n",
      "Why is it always me? I work twelve hours a week, you know!\n",
      "Oh, right.\n",
      "Could someone bring me another barf cone?\n",
      "Yeah, Dad! You're a big fat loudmouth. And you can walk when you have to.\n",
      "Ladies, grab your pebbles!\n",
      "I'd like to cash in these chips. Give me most of it in cash and the rest in suitcases to carry the cash.\n",
      "Mm hm. Two o'clock is fine. Thank you, Dr. Hibbert.\n",
      "It would be the day my childhood ended.\n",
      "Krusty?\n",
      "With a virgin Tom Collins for me?\n",
      "Please Dad.\n",
      "What's that extra b for?\n",
      "Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Quit it. Ow! Quit it.\n",
      "Well, now that hypnotist is gonna come back and snap him out of it!\n",
      "You know, we've been through some two hundred and eighty adventures together, but our bond has never been stronger.\n",
      "Nah, it's just as well. That handsome face was nice, but it was too much maintenance. I had to wash it, rub it with neat's-foot oil... You did me a favor, Homer. And to think I was about to sell the bar to Hooters...\n",
      "Aren't you tired of having to peel that last snotty Kleenex from the bottom of your wastebasket?\n",
      "Do you know who else was really into rowboats? Jesus. And he could've turned his rowboat into a jet ski, but he didn't. Good guy.\n",
      "Thanks, Dad. Sure you're not gonna be bored?\n",
      "Yeah. So uh... it's five o'clock. Time for Moe's.\n",
      "Okay, Marge. But don't be surprised if a snuggle monster shows up.\n",
      "This isn't a happy thing!\n",
      "Maggie, help me with this shirt.\n",
      "Oh my.\n",
      "We know. Frank Grimes, Jr.\n",
      "Please give me back my boy! I just want to tell him I love him one more time.\n",

      "I'm telling you, I saw a creature from another planet.\n",
      "Guess what, Homie... There's going to be twice as much love in this house as there is now.\n",
      "Ah, home to my loving family. What more can a man ask for?\n",
      "Look, it's celebrity boy-toy Ned Flanders and his arm candy, Sara Sloane.\n",
      "Really? It must be the Champale talking.\n",
      "And Lisa, you have a choice. You may continue to be challenged in third grade, or return to second grade and be merely a big fish in a small pond--\n",
      "Homer...\n",
      "Mom, that's veal.\n",
      "You had no right to make my bosom this ample!\n",
      "Uh, Maybe.\n",
      "Well, it's pretty ingrained.\n",
      "Well, maybe you added it wrong. Let me add it...\n",
      "Hey, boy! In here!\n",
      "She said I didn't suck?\n",
      "I think somebody's afraid to admit he's out of glaze.\n",
      "Grown-up nerds like Gore Vidal. And even he's kissed more boys than I ever will.\n",
      "Krusty funny.\n",
      "...doomed to get only single pneumonia.\n",
      "Oh, yeah, I got that.\n",
      "Hey, Barney! Soul mate! Let me buy you a beer.\n",
      "And I always got the spillover. Drive-in movies, two Christmases, soda with dinner -- we lived like kings!\n",
      "Oh-ho-ho-ho, please. You're gonna give me a swelled head. I just stopped by to see if you needed anything.\n",
      "Dear Log: My worst fears have been confirmed. I've hit my mental and creative peak at the tender age of eight. What will my life be like after I descend into mediocrity?\n",
      "This is why I can't have nice things.\n",
      "Sorry to break character, but these stunt pants are getting pretty toasty!\n",
      "Now you're swingin', honey!\n",
      "This is the stupidest fight ever!\n",
      "I am!\n",
      "If they was me they'd be done by now.\n",
      "Get with the program, Marge. Your husband is now an ambulance driver!\n",
      "Aw, this isn't the right one -- she wants the baby!\n",
      "Nice fella. I wonder if he's gay?\n",
      "Nice try, Todd.\n",
      "La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la!\n",
      "Oh, Homie. You're good at lots of things.\n",
      "Pressure too high?\n",
      "All right. All right. Bart, go to your room.\n",
      "I'm sure she'd be proud that her descendants had piping hot tap water and plenty of warm, dry underwear.\n",
      "Say your name? Why should I do that, my lad?\n",
      "Boy, I never thought I'd have my own dark room.\n",
      "Son, I just want you to know, whatever that judge decides, I'm gonna be the best dad I can.\n",
      "Hey, Mom, look!\n",
      "Now we give them the bikes, no one sues.\n",
      "What's the difference between this lamb and the one that kissed me?\n",
      "Way to go, Slim!\n",
      "I guess this is gonna have to be decided by a higher power.\n",
      "You see? A little persistence and patience paid off. That'll be 300 dollars.\n",
      "Aw... I mean arrrgh!\n",
      "That's right. That's my pop!\n",
      "Follow... the... This must be why I'm here! Follow the what? Follow the what? Hurry up!\n",
      "What about a robot with a human brain?\n",
      "I brought Homer here to show that we can, and have, abstained for two whole days.\n",
      "Who is it? Is it anybody?\n",
      "Oh, come on, Dad, I promise we'll have more fun this time. We're gonna see lions.\n",
      "Great, great -- I turned over so many wheelbarrows... Wait, that was your thing.\n",
      "Right. Bart, you stay home and tape the hockey game.\n",
      "You wanna talk about it?\n",
      "Yeah!\n",
      "Janey.\n",
      "Can't talk, praying. Dear Lord, the gods have been good to me and I am thankful. For the first time in my life, everything is absolutely perfect just the way it is.\n",
      "Too rich for my blood. I should not have anted with my blood.\n",
      "No, ma'am.\n",
      "Well, it used to be.\n",
      "Cherries!\n",
      "My what?\n",
      "Decided? That's classic. Decided. Babies just happen.\n",
      "You could raise some emus...\n",
      "Stickin' it to you for killin' off my character!\n",
      "Eeech.\n",
      "Ooh, she wants to know how your life is going.\n",
      "Well explain to me why it isn't.\n",
      "What in blue blazes do you think you're doing, Simpson?\n",
      "Did not.\n",
      "That's a smile, right? Showin' teeth, eyes all crinkly.\n",
      "You're pregnant?!\n",
      "Sorry.\n",
      "Well then...\n",
      "Don't you get it? He swore he'd kill me too. I'm next!\n",
      "Good, 'cause I need directions.\n",
      "Now do-se-do...\n",
      "Artie Ziff! Why are you living in our attic?\n",
      "Yes, Virgil?\n",
      "Okay, everyone. My best friend is a little messed up, so everyone be extra nice to him.\n",
      "Say, who are you guys?\n",
      "That's me.\n",
      "Woo woo! All right! I always knew you had personality. The doctors said it was hyperactivity, but I knew better. President Simpson. Has a nice ring to it, doesn't it, boy?\n",
      "Prove it, Hollywood!\n",
      "This election is on every channel.\n",
      "But--\n",
      "Thanks for trying, guys, but Sideshow Bob wants me dead, and Sideshow Bob is an unstoppable killing machine.\n",
      "See you in Hell, soldier boy!\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Oh, look! A shooting star!\n",
      "I want to go on a boat ride, Unky Herb.\n",
      "Let's just leave the crazy woman alone in our house. We've got something more important to attend to.\n",
      "Yeah, who'd've thought he'd turn out to be such a weirdo?\n",
      "Oh, don't call me lady. My name is Marge Simpson, this is my family and we're not going anywhere. We're all going to have to live together, so you better get used to it... please.\n",
      "Who did this? Until I find out, no one is leaving this mixed-use auditorium.\n",
      "You're going down, my friend.\n",
      "Homer.\n",
      "The mouse is named Itchy.\n",
      "Dad, if we're gonna race Duncan, shouldn't we hire a professional trainer?\n",
      "Homer, quiet. You'll queer the deal.\n",
      "Now there must be a way out!\n",
      "Well, I'm sure these things didn't destroy themselves, now did they?\n",
      "Man, that's some story.\n",
      "Boy, a good man really is hard to find.\n",
      "Deal!\n",
      "White. And what would you like for appetizers?\n",
      "This proves Bart lied about being kidnapped!\n",
      "Why you little bastard...\n",
      "Ooo, looks like a sandstorm's brewin'. I'll just wait it out at a movie.\n",
      "Are you doing an app behind my back?\n",
      "What do you weigh? Like a million pounds?\n",
      "Never!\n",
      "Man, this place looks expensive. I feel like I'm wasting a fortune just standing here. Better make the most of it.\n",
      "Wow, your paintings have brush marks and your statues have wieners!\n",
      "But Dad said I had to finish--\n",
      "Oh, that sounds too complicated.\n",
      "If you don't let us watch, we'll just go to a house where some more permissive parents will.\n",
      "How is the Feast of Twelve Delights with Triple Happiness Sauce?\n",
      "Yeah, look!\n",
      "Look at all those worried faces -- except for Lenny. He looks great.\n",
      "Okay Bart, be cool. Calm down. You're not gonna die up here.\n",
      "Yeah, it'll be fun. Fresh country air, apples for the pickin'... sing-along hayrides...\n",
      "Like Halloween and Christmas, April Fool's Day traces its origins to pagan ritual.\n",
      "What? You told me I should do something with my life.\n",
      "All right, screw it. Let's roll.\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Oh man, this is great. The most evil man in town is in our power. He will do my bidding... at that fantasy football auction. And anything else my limited imagination can come up with.\n",
      "Now, while the plant is brought up to code, there will be massive layoffs. That is to say, total layoffs. Toodles!\n",
      "Homer! Watch your mouth!\n",
      "Sure, why not.\n",
      "A little singing? If there's one thing he did not have to genetically enhance, it's his voice.\n",
      "Her films are so lyrical! The phone lines are gonna be jammed.\n",
      "No, a guy at work seems not to like me. I guess it's not much when you look at real problems in the world like major league umpires not using instant replay.\n",
      "Split up?! Marge, no! We can fix this marriage!\n",
      "You have a special tie to your sister...\n",
      "Our wedding china's ruined.\n",
      "Read the bosom part again, Dad.\n",
      "So how do you know so much about American history?\n",
      "Now children, you can have one piece of candy tonight and save the rest for...\n",
      "And, of course, I resist all the major urges.\n",
      "Oh my God! Dad threw too hard!\n",
      "Come on now, just a little more. Little more to the left... to the left there. What did he do this thing? Almost... Ahhhhhhhhh\n",
      "With you, every day is Guy Fawkes Day!\n",
      "You know, Mother, I wasn't sure about tonight. But seeing us dressed the same really feels right!\n",
      "Bart, I've barely been here a good solid week, and you've been sent to my office eleven times. And now that I have peanut butter cups, you seem to be gettin' in trouble every hour.\n",
      "May I please be excused for a minute?\n",
      "Hello, son.\n",
      "We can fly over them with the power of love, right?\n",
      "Please Lis, they prefer to be called the Living Impaired.\n",
      "Okay. Time for truth or dare. You go first.\n",
      "I've been listening, and Dad stops breathing for as long as five minutes. Mind if I sleep with you guys and keep an eye on him?\n",
      "Whoa, it worked!\n",
      "See? Luckiest man in the world.\n",
      "Huh. Maybe I should clear the air.\n",
      "For a superior race, they really rub it in.\n",
      "Well, are you gonna talk about it, or are you gonna do it?\n",
      "Marge!\n",
      "You told me something, but I wasn't listening!\n",
      "I don't recall being consulted when you bought that hat.\n",
      "Oooh... entertainment.\n",
      "Psst. Bishop to queen four.\n",
      "I'm afraid what I like can't be swallowed, sniffed or smoked.\n",
      "Yahhh!\n",
      "How can you say a thing like that?\n",
      "Huh?\n",
      "Sweet.\n",
      "This place is amazing! Kiosks! Outdoor study groups!\n",
      "Huh?... There have been so many classic Simpson moments. I remember that time I tried to jump over Springfield gorge...\n",
      "Fun me... fun me... fun me...\n",
      "How're you doin', Mr. Assange?\n",
      "Hey, these are Red Vines. Here you go, sweetie. Daddy got you your candy.\n",
      "Dallas! Whoo-hoo!\n",
      "No, all those bald children are arousing suspicion -- to the park!\n",
      "Aw, hey that's the guy what created him! If Homer had used some protection, we'd all be poopin' roses on easy street!\n",
      "That's not true, honey. You can always write a depressing Broadway play of some kind.\n",
      "How am I supposed to get home?\n",
      "How'd you think of such perfect things for us to do? Did Mom help you?\n",
      "While you were out there daydreaming, this rain has ruined the house.\n",
      "Dis-embroider the crew jackets. We can still send them back.\n",
      "Oh, man, that's good. Pass the butter.\n",
      "Going cold turkey isn't as delicious as it sounds.\n",

      "Halftime, Marge, halftime.\n",
      "Homie... every year this party gets a little bigger. I'm afraid it's growing out of hand.\n",

      "But now the ties are motionless. And those in back are virtually inaccessible! Well, it's a moot point, as I have only one tie to begin with. I believe I'll pass.\n",
      "Everyone in that live studio audience is dead now.\n",
      "So that's why I love drinking so much.\n",
      "Now, Marge, you can't blame all of Bart's problems on your one little speech. If anything turned him bad, it's that time you let him wear a bathing suit instead of underwear. And let's not forget your little speech...\n",

      "Humph... where would an innocent child get the idea to attack her father with a mallet?\n",
      "Okay, let's make a pact. This is gonna be the best vacation ever, or we all agree to disband and join other families.\n",
      "Hm. Not as much money as there used to be.\n",

      "I drove a car over a cliff once. How different could it be?\n",
      "Ninety percent of the time, if the gas isn't pumping, this is your problem.\n",
      "That's the highest point. And only fifteen minutes to go.\n",

      "Not air bites, real bites.\n",
      "What fun!\n",
      "Thank you, Mr. Simpson.\n",
      "Thank God I'm not in the shower!\n",
      "Hmmm... The only problem is, I'm sure to retain some image of coming home and finding Duffman. No doubt I'll misconstrue that as him placing a cuckold's horns upon my brow. And that will make me want to jump off a--\n",
      "He looks happy.\n",
      "No one even plays four-square anymore -- they just gossip.\n",
      "Okay, the material was a little corny, but Homer and I had real chemistry onscreen.\n",
      "No it doesn't!\n",
      "When I grow up, I want to be in the Betty Ford Center.\n",
      "Well, let me sew that up for you.\n",
      "Darn her socks?... I say, darn her! I'll do them and then I'm outta here.\n",
      "Listen, we swore we'd never go to sleep angry at each other.\n",

      "Yeah...\n",
      "Gambling.\n",
      "Butter.\n",
      "It's a pig!\n",
      "It sure is great to look down my nose at everybody again. Mind if I waggle my finger a little bit?\n",
      "All right, it's closing time. Who's paying the tab?\n",
      "It's not a real car, Grampa.\n",
      "Bart. Bart Bart Bart Bart Bart.\n",

      "Or, if not then, Christmas.\n",
      "Hugh, there's something I want you to have. My Dad gave me his cuff links to wear on the day I married Marge, and they brought us good luck. I couldn't imagine a happier marriage. We don't have many traditions in our family, but it'd mean a lot to me if you kept this one alive.\n",
      "How about this Henny Penny? If Bart wins tomorrow, you have to mow my lawn.\n",
      "Unky Herb, what advice would you give to a boy who will most likely become a bum like yourself?\n",
      "Yes. Yes it is.\n",
      "He made it! He's finally protected from man.\n",
      "A coupla times.\n",
      "Chewin' stuff?!\n",
      "...so we hitched us a ride on a three-hump gumbamel!\n",
      "Hm. Better add some more nails.\n",
      "Stupid Nelson! I hate that guy.\n",

      "I hate this place! It's nothing like the brochure.\n",
      "They're forcing 'em.\n",
      "So it's agreed: we cancel the rest of the primaries and offer the G.O.P. nomination to this knee-high want-wit.\n",
      "Hey, Bartle- eeboobely, care for a steak-a-rooney?\n",
      "You came back!\n",
      "Impersonate my mother, will you? And you, Smithers! You must have put him up to it! I'm glad I fired you.\n",

      "Look Maggie, they have a baby, too.\n",
      "STEP BACK, MOM! IT'S BART'S TURN NOW! / EAT MY SHORTS! DON'T HAVE A COW!\n",
      "You mean like... an angel?!!\n",
      "Yes, Bart. Why don't you try it and see?\n",
      "I don't know... a hundred and two?\n",
      "Hey, why am I running from a girl?\n",
      "Oh Lisa!\n",
      "Is it Milhouse?\n",
      "Dad, you cannot wear that! That's a rastafarian hat!\n",
      "We can't keep living like this. Moses, ask Pharaoh to let your people go.\n",
      "Dad, we may have saved your soul.\n",
      "We need a third maid. Maybe someone will step in and help.\n",
      "Shut up, Flanders. Hey dad, how come we can't get a decent mower like the Flanders?\n",
      "Homer, for the last time, I am not putting that in.\n",
      "Well, giving him a kidney is a wonderful way to show him how you feel.\n",
      "I don't know.\n",
      "Ow! What's that supposed to prove?\n",
      "I can't talk now, I'm talking to myself! No, no, Homer, go ahead. Thanks, Homer, it'll just be a minute. What's up?\n",
      "Or, maybe we can nurse him back to health and set him free in the wild.\n",
      "Gotta go.\n",
      "The reason I left you is simple:,the reason i left you is simple,7\n",
      "But I'd look good on the outside, right?\n",
      "Liberals!\n",
      "But Grampa...\n",
      "What's really amazing is that this is exactly what Dad said would happen.\n",
      "Well, we were lucky this time. But it's all too clear that some things in this universe aren't meant to be trifled with.\n",
      "So you're saying we're definitely gonna win? -- Woo hoo! I won't need this any more!\n",
      "Don't jinx it!\n",
      "Good. Then here are some cupcakes.\n",
      "Excuse me. The podiums are needed in the art room as easels.\n",
      "Well, with some school band music and added effects, we could show Lisa's film at the public library.\n",
      "Oh Lisa, honey, you can't insulate yourself from life. Why I could live till a hundred or a bus could hit me tomorrow. That's why I never plan more than four seconds ahead.\n",
      "Well, what you've gotta do is get them into the real world.\n",
      "Uh, yeah, me. I use it all the time.\n",
      "This lunkhead?\n",

      "But then they'll just beat me up even worse.\n",
      "Why are you dressed like Catwoman?\n",
      "Acquitted?! Then my nightmare isn't over?\n",
      "Or as the Indians call it, maize. Another famous Indian was Crazy Horse. In conclusion, Libya is a land of contrasts. Thank you.\n",
      "Ahhh, bacon.\n",
      "Well, when the sun goes down it means God's gone to China to watch over those good folks. Time for some shuteye.\n",
      "Blankets, radio... Oh, a Gary Larson calendar. I don't get it. I don't get it. I don't get it. I don't get it. I--don't get it.\n",
      "Dad, do you remember why you entered me in that pageant?\n",
      "Breakfast!\n",
      "Suppose someone wanted to buy it from you?\n",
      "Great plan, Bart.\n",
      "But my prediction says--\n",
      "Do you have to talk like that?\n",
      "No, I mean teacher.\n",
      "Booting?\n",
      "Girl Scout cookies get you in anywhere.\n",
      "Lots more coffee. Are you getting ready for bed, Bart?\n",
      "And... let's roll.\n",
      "Stop winking.\n",
      "Y'ello.\n",
      "Ew, that's gross.\n",
      "Oh, let's face it. I'm the one that's brought this fate upon us. And there's only one way out: I've gotta man up. Okay, manning up... manning up. Mannning-- Girling down! Girling down!\n",
      "Are you?\n",
      "You're doing that the sucker way. Try a little vitamin G.\n",
      "Who's next?\n",
      "The bed is lifting me! The elevator at work can't even do that! I demand you put me down right after the sex!\n",
      "Yah!\n",
      "Craaaaaaaaaap!\n",
      "Yeah, I'd like to speak to a Mr. Tabooger. First name, Ollie.\n",
      "Plain, plain, plain, plain, fruit!\n",
      "Dad!\n",
      "A civilian! She mustn't know I'm a hero! Gouge her eyes out!\n",
      "Check it out, Flanders, us cool dads are sharing a mono-yard. Guess I can't be your best friend anymore.\n",
      "I've got perfume spritzers.\n",
      "Um, Dad...\n",
      "No. But you did do something. You made me love baseball. Not as a collection of numbers, but as an unpredictable, passionate game beaten in excitement only by every other sport.\n",
      "I can still hear her. I'd better do something.\n",
      "Mr. Seltzer?\n",
      "Awww, they're using the jerky to feed their family! Look, there's a Homer and a Bart and a Marge and a Lisa. Aww... and they even share my views on parenting!\n",
      "Hey, hey, that's not your ball.\n",
      "Homer!\n",
      "Oh, my God! Oh, my God!\n",
      "Because they discovered gold right over there--\n",
      "Hey, any more arboretums around here?\n",
      "Fresh is a dollar, rotten's two bucks.\n",
      "Put that down! We're being audited!\n",
      "That was a sexual harassment seminar!\n",
      "Hey, is that a camera in the ceiling?\n",
      "Oh, man!\n",
      "But Ned, saying nay is your thing.\n",
      "Help me God!\n",
      "Otto. That's one palindrome you won't be hearing for awhile.\n",

      "Dad, wait, I've got a story about why revenge is wrong.\n",
      "Now it's two sets of twins.\n",
      "Posh. Shredded newspapers add much needed roughage and essential inks. Besides, you didn't notice the old gym mats.\n",
      "Oh, those awful women want their omelettes.\n",

      "Oh, by the way, I was being sarcastic.\n",
      "Oh man. Fine.\n",
      "Wouldn't it be easier if I just took acting lessons?\n",
      "Just a minute! Don't hang up!\n",
      "Me too.\n",
      "Mr. Blackheart?\n",
      "Hi, Dad. Want me to cut out this infernal racket?\n",
      "Oh, I'm not decent. Let me throw something on!\n",

      "Hmm. It's gonna take a lot of fireworks to clean this place up.\n",
      "This broadcast is from 1979.\n",
      "Well, you'd better hurry. I don't think Dad can last much longer where he's hiding.\n",
      "Oh, hey, hey. Maybe some things are too good to be kept a secret.\n",
      "Go up to the attic. There's a whole trunk of clothes up there.\n",
      "God you're hilarious.\n",
      "Do you think Lisa went to that jazz club I wouldn't take her to?\n",
      "For what?\n",

      "Oh come on, don't you get it? Bart stopped time with his magic stopwatch.\n",
      "Oh, so that's his little game. Get this Simpson character up here right now.\n",
      "Oh, I just mopped that driveway.\n",
      "Dad, the chloroform!\n",
      "Yes, it always saddens me that you and Sheldon have never gotten along.\n",

      "Thanks, but... what are you holding on to?\n",
      "Have we gotten all the liquor?\n",
      "Why are we cleaning this room? I don't think we were even in here.\n",
      "More like pre-school.\n",
      "When it's closed it's a chair! When you were little, I used to take you to a Mommy-and-Me toddler gym.\n",
      "Yeah, I make up words too. Anyway, I was wondering if you could pretend to lose to me in a skateboarding contest so I can be a hero to my boy again.\n",

      "Uh... don't get me wrong. I mean you're an honest man. I just meant that you could afford to run for governor, if you felt like it. 'Course I'm just rambling because... uh... because you keep staring at me like that, but, but it's true. I mean, if you were governor, you could decide what's safe and what isn't.\n",

      "Oh, forget it.\n",
      "Well, he's got my vote.\n",

      "If you really love Larry, prove it and you can have him back today.\n",
      "Now, that's your third helping, young man. It's making you fat and soft... and tender. Hmmm... Uh, you just cut in line, didn't you? Report to detention, Uter.\n",
      "Honey, don't get obsessed with that. Focus on the good things. Like this fire extinguisher I got at the fair.\n",

      "There! Isn't that a lot better? Now you can do whatever you want. But don't mess up the house.\n",
      "Well, this sounds like bad news.\n",
      "Dirty love. I mean, thirty love. I mean, anyone for penis? I'll just get the shuttlecock.\n",
      "Absolutely. We had stopped in for a quick prayer, when... Bart, would you call him a crazy man?\n",
      "No. There is absolutely nothing else to tell you about this house.\n",
      "Just wait.\n",
      "I'm also fat!\n",
      "Uh-oh.\n",
      "That's nice, Bart. You know your father wanted to be a policeman for a little while. But they said he was too heavy.\n",
      "Well, excuse me, for being a powerful yet careless lover.\n",
      "A little's not gonna be enough, honey pie.\n",
      "Keep guessing...\n",
      "I wish I'd never met you!\n",

      "Homer.\n",
      "Woo-hoo!\n",
      "What's the point? There's no more money. Unless you've got some magic new source of revenue.\n",
      "Thanks... uh... Say, are you guys crooks?\n",
      "I found the missing puzzle piece. It was under Maggie's eyelid!\n",
      "Don't worry, boy. We'll get some grub. Even if we have to pay for it.\n",
      "Sorry, lady. I know you. You're Kim Basinger\n",
      "Lisa, I've just arrived at the Springfield dump. A lot of things get thrown out here. Sometimes, even a human being. Somewhere in this pile of twisted metal and soiled mattresses...\n",
      "Okay, but I know funny.\n",
      "I've learned my lesson!\n",

      "Oh... Adil's a very sweet boy.\n",
      "I'll just hang out next to girls' juvie.\n",
      "So, that's our story. Oh wait, we were attacked by a giant whale. He turned out to be pretty cool.\n",
      "Well, I really gave him no choice. Y'see...\n",
      "Canary M. Burns.\n",
      "Where?\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Lisa, I don't know what you're doing, but it's very strange and your father is trying to worry.\n",
      "Santa?\n",
      "So many horses. I don't know who to vote for. Can't I just bet that all the horses will have a fun time?\n",
      "Jubilee!\n",
      "Oh, all right. Good-bye, sweetheart, have a nice trip.\n",
      "To Moe -- From Your Secret Admirer.\n",
      "What's happening to me? Maybe I'm not a kid anymore.\n",
      "Well, I don't know... it's a lot of work.\n",
      "Homer, tell your child what you bought when I sent you to town to get some insurance.\n",
      "Ned, I'm an American tourist. I'm just here to see some sights, try goofy new food and spread some shekels with my Carolina Panthers credit card.\n",
      "Yeeesch! This house stinks! You're not just putting the new newspapers over the old ones, are you?\n",
      "Yeah I was on today. Scary on.\n",
      "What's brunch?\n",
      "C'mon, c'mon, we all have to pitch in and eat your father's share.\n",
      "Stop saying things!\n",

      "Really? On top and underneath?\n",
      "We're doomed!\n",
      "Yeah? Why would they believe you?\n",
      "Mm-hmm.\n",
      "But, Homer, it's so expensive.\n",
      "I guess it's just how I was raised.\n",
      "He's dressed without flair.\n",
      "I wish they had never invented fried cheese!\n",
      "Ah, yes. Ghastly business, that.\n",
      "That is one bitchin' bike!\n",
      "There we go. Clean... and white... and soft.\n",

      "Hi.\n",
      "Nobody likes a tattletale, honey.\n",
      "What else do they got?\n",
      "Hurry, hurry up! I have to pee!\n",
      "Ooh, it's dinner time!\n",
      "Boy, they sure love soccer here.\n",
      "Oh, Homer. How many times do I have to fluff your pillow?\n",
      "Hmm?\n",
      "Oh, now you're dragging hot dogs into this. Real classy, Marge. Real classy.\n",
      "Look, that's our ship!\n",
      "I tackled a loafer at work today.\n",
      "I've been waiting twenty-five years for this moment.\n",
      "Hey look, there's Copacabana beach. The heart and soul or Rio.\n",
      "Alright, alright. I'll split the million with Homer. Jeepers, Mary and Joseph. I sleep with a chick once, it costs me a half a million bananas.\n",
      "Go, Seminoles!\n",
      "Hey, Moe, can you keep a secret?\n",
      "But...\n",

      "Why are we stopping here?\n",
      "No you're not. He's really not.\n",
      "Well, it was written in 1845. Maybe people were easier to scare back then.\n",
      "Those dirty rotten...\n",
      "You told!\n",
      "God bless those pagans.\n",
      "Hey, hey, who pulled the pin on this one?\n",
      "Hello?\n",
      "Oh Homie. I'm so sorry.\n",
      "Homer, I'm so sorry. Have a free beer.\n",
      "So if I turn my radio on at nine o'clock...\n",
      "Americanize this, my good man.\n",
      "The boat's going sideways!\n",

      "Take it to the hoop, Selma.\n",
      "I know.\n",
      "Krusty, we're desperate here. We need you to turn your campaign around.\n",
      "Oh frabjulous day! Calloo Callay!\n",
      "This isn't over, Becky. I know where you live: My house!\n",
      "I guess -- they're Homer's expired pain medications.\n",
      "Mom, I think there's a danger this time they might lose the Ponderosa!\n",
      "I lied about being kidnapped. The whole thing was a hoax.\n",

      "I don't recall that.\n",
      "I feel kind of... melancholy...\n",
      "Lord, this town may have turned its back on you, but not the Flanderses. Wherever we are, you'll have your church. Are you with me, boys?\n",
      "Enough! While you morons are canoodling, someone's burgling my miscellania!\n",
      "I'm sorry, but the team all got food poisoning at the pre-rally egg salad sandwich party. Luckily, as equipment manager, I... was not... invited! Woo-hoo!\n",
      "Smithers... wait!\n",
      "Uh, uh, you punch really good!\n",
      "What could be more exciting than the savage ballet that is pro football?\n",
      "All right. It's giant slayin' time...\n",
      "This is my lucky day.\n",
      "Well... I guess this thing does look pretty silly. Let's all take off our sandwich boards and watch TV.\n",
      "That's it. I'm blowing off the dance. This is the biggest thing that's happened to me since chocolate milk.\n",
      "Grease yourself up and go in, you-you... guff-speaking work-slacker.\n",
      "The Fox network has sunk to a new low.\n",
      "How was your day? Do you really want to know?\n",
      "Shhh. We're trespassing. And some of these farmers have pitchforks.\n",
      "Well that's too bad, because many of you will not be going.\n",
      "Hey ho Simpson.\n",
      "Dad... I need help... Please...\n",
      "Well, there's certainly no greater accomplishment than fathering three beautiful children.\n",

      "Comin' through!\n",
      "No! No, not the iodine! Burn the germs off with a torch, amputate my arm, but not the -- YAAAUUUGGGHHH!\n",
      "A koi pond! It's beautiful. Oh you sweet, wonderful man-child. I finally have a peaceful place to sit and hear my own thoughts.\n",
      "Great, Mom. Now I lost track of my pump count. One pump, two pump...\n",
      "Of course! It's simplicity itself! I won't forget this, Simpson. Now return to your work, and tell no one of what transpired here.\n",
      "What's the matter, Homer?\n",
      "Stupid spider... afraid of dying.\n",
      "SWEET ADELEINE.\n",
      "Easy, Ned, don't breathe in.\n",
      "It's hopeless. I can't make up for ten years of goofing off in one day. I need two days!\n",
      "Well, what do ya got him peein' on?\n",
      "It was amazing how fast Dad betrayed his vision of a realistic show.\n",
      "Who are you guys?\n",
      "Even better! They're bags of seeds, so that you can plant a garden and watch it grow.\n",
      "I only eat the clown heads.\n",
      "Looks like the red light's on.\n",
      "Homer, what are you doing?\n",
      "I've got two teens in a public park goin' at it like a couple of gibbons in the back seat of Noah's Ark!\n",
      "Oh no we won't!\n",

      "I liked that story 'cause I was a Judge.\n",
      "Wait, wait, Michael! You go sit at the piano and I'll boil some coffee.\n",
      "You're done. Next!\n",
      "Hey! Ah! Stop it, you creep!\n",
      "I know what must have happened:\n",
      "I said, pipe down, Amtrak.\n",
      "Dad, the bill's only a hundred.\n",
      "Wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute. Lisa, honey -- are you saying you're never going to eat any animal again? What about bacon?\n",
      "Clean house, no silverfish... I coulda been very happy here.\n",
      "Oh, it's a great team, Kent... never gave up hope... I want to thank Jesus... and say hi to my special lady Marge... We did it, baby! Wooooo! Woooooo!\n",
      "Well, if I were a member, we could use my rumpus room as our lair.\n",
      "Oh, it's a great hat. No one's questioning the hat.\n",
      "Mm hmm! Open as a tomb on Easter. Now, what can I ding dong diddily do for ya?\n",
      "Thank you, Lord! It's back the way it was.\n",
      "Sweet dreams, my new best friend.\n",
      "The entire town turned out to jeer me. Me, whose velvet breeches their lizard lips had so often joylessly smooched.\n",
      "I'll stay here, but I'm gonna think about products I might like to purchase.\n",
      "Yeah, honey. Even if you don't succeed in the business world, you're still the world's greatest wife and mother.\n",
      "Oh, wait. Here we go...\n",
      "Look, look, Marge. I can't afford it. When I can afford to pay for it, I will. But I can't, so I'm not going to.\n",
      "Is he still out there?\n",
      "'Cause in a head-to-head battle, the one with the most brains wins!\n",
      "Mom, that was incredible!\n",
      "Wow! Look at all these toilets. And just inches from your bed. Talk about luxury.\n",
      "You got a letter too, Bart.\n",
      "Well, enjoy it while you can. Everything changes when you hit the big one-oh. Your legs start to go... candy doesn't taste as good anymore --\n",
      "Good Lord! Bart's mooning the flag!\n",
      "Smile! Like this!\n",
      "No, I'm sorry.\n",
      "Sure.\n",
      "Oh, I really need one more day, Mom. I think the germs are regrouping. Now for breakfast I'll have hash browns, coffee and a short stack. And would it kill you to heat up the syrup?\n",
      "Oh, Dad's gonna die and it's all my fault! I really need a good talkin' to.\n",
      "Edna, I'm gonna pop you a question and... I hope the answer is yes.\n",
      "Mr. G. K. Willington is not who he seems. In fact, he's someone you all know quite well!\n",
      "What's with the Canadian flag on your backpack?\n",
      "Whoa, whoa, whoa, what are you doin'? That leads to the daycare center. You take the freight elevator.\n",

      "You've been through a traumatic experience. Are you sure you wanna go to work today?\n",
      "No way! You can't give my dog away! I'll set fire to my hair! I'll rip up all my clothes! I'll put sugar in the gas tank!\n",
      "What the?! I've been writin' creepy letters to that?!\n",
      "Or one of these other dining clubs? Look at them circling me like I'm Cinderella, belle of the ball!\n",
      "Is that what I think it is?\n",
      "Would you look at me. I'm the happiest bartender in the world.\n",
      "You can't leave, I'm your ride home!\n",
      "Okay, okay I'll let him. But then I get a chipwich, okay?\n",
      "Just testing.\n",
      "Well, maybe if we snuggle, it might rattle some memories loose.\n",
      "I'm just trying to liven things up around here. These people need to ride motorcycles and play rockin' electric guitars like the old people on TV.\n",
      "Seymour, this is an absent slip signed by Nelson's mother. And this is Nelson's English homework. Notice the identical elongated loops on the d's.\n",

      "Oh no! I don't have to listen to you. If I'm not on camera, you can't see me!\n",
      "Well, perhaps. Smithers go to my office. In the third drawer of my desk are surgical tools and some ether...\n",
      "Ah, here you go, precious. Now go off with your friends.\n",
      "Fine. Thank you.\n",

      "Part two...\n",
      "What are you doing in my corpse-hatch?\n",
      "Me? But you were doing such a great job.\n",
      "Yes, Dad.\n",

      "I SAW YOU LAST NIGHT AT THE SPELLING BEE...\n",
      "It's all gone. Everything... gone-diddily-on.\n",
      "Not bad. We had pizza, cake, and then sang songs with Nelson's Gramma. But, it was a one-time thing, and now I'll never see him again.\n",
      "I wish I had Amoria Phlebitis.\n",
      "No you may not!\n",
      "No! Homer Simpson does not lie twice on the same form. He never has and he never will.\n",
      "Get back in the garage, old man.\n",
      "Dad! What a nice surprise.\n",
      "That is good because eating animals is wrong.\n",
      "Those are pretty cute...\n",
      "It looked a lot better in my memory. But do you know what, Smithers? I will find Lilah and win her back... I'll just check with the old gang. Hemingway!\n",
      "But first, m'lady, let me escort you to Heaven -- the fancy Swiss chocolate store on level three!\n",
      "Hello? Oh, hello, Principal Skinner... No, Bart has never been to Hong Kong... Goodnight.\n",
      "All right, let's cut to the chase. My board has given me permission to go up to... twelve goats.\n",
      "Shuut-uup...\n",
      "Oh, man. This is the most exciting thing I've seen since Haley's Comet collided with the moon!\n",
      "Dad, isn't this stealing?\n",
      "I quit.\n",

      "I'd love to -- Partner!\n",
      "Every car's been harvested!\n",
      "It's no use. I guess I'll have to leave all my money to the Egg Advisory Council. Eggs have gotten quite a bad rap lately, you know, Smithers.\n",
      "Ha ha, you love me.\n",
      "C'mon. You shouldn't be spending your last hours of bachelorhood in a dump like this.\n",
      "Hey, Barney. What's with the glum face? You glum or somethin'? Huh, Glummy?\n",

      "Because we're kids. Kids! Maybe that's the answer.\n",
      "You can't make that stuff up!\n",
      "That's odd. The outside looks like a tomato, but the inside is brown.\n",
      "Fine, fine! Homer! Give him a party!\n",
      "Well, Homer, I have to admit, you created something people really love. You truly are an artist.\n",

      "My mother's dead.\n",
      "Hey, Karie.\n",
      "No, Homer, being an artist was my dream. But now, without even trying, you've accomplished more in a week than I have in my whole life.\n",
      "I'm sure you won't enjoy it. There's nothing about bowling in the play... Oh wait, there is.\n",
      "Come on, Mom, the stores just invented this holiday to make money.\n",
      "It's all gonna thaw!\n",
      "We've squabbled over money before -- never this much -- I mean, I know this is different than that time I washed your pants with the twenty in the pocket, but I--\n",
      "Stop it! Stop it!!! I'll watch the commercials!\n",
      "Wheee!\n",
      "That's my girl!\n",
      "A shiny new dime!\n",
      "Sounds good to me!\n",
      "There's Bart's ring!\n",
      "Centered. Centered. You know where the four states come together?\n",
      "Marge, I'm only human. Now look, here's what we're gonna do. We'll unload the kids on Patty and Selma Saturday night. And then we'll eat until they kick us out of the place. Just like old times.\n",
      "This is nuts!\n",
      "Look! Grampa's a gorilla, Sideshow Mel is Spiderman, and Nelson's a raccoon...\n",
      "Now, a simple Sunday drive will reveal the hidden wonders of our hometown!\n",
      "Forgot my keys.\n",
      "Hakala makta towhoo abowhoo.\n",

      "I asked for light starch on my nightcap!\n",
      "I never heard Maggie laugh like that before.\n",
      "Oh, it's you.\n",
      "Garbage! What matchbook art school did you flunk out of, you ham-fisted, nearsighted house painter? Smithers, throw this on the dung heap.\n",
      "All right, then.\n",
      "Homer, it's just a coincidence, like that guy named Anthony Michael Hall who stole your car stereo.\n",
      "I know you are, but what am I?\n",
      "Way to go, officer!\n",
      "Bart Simpson on the side of law and order? Has the world gone topsy-turvy?\n",
      "Though thy crest be shorn and shaven, thou --\n",
      "Well, okay. Let's go.\n",
      "How did that happen?\n",
      "Stop burning!\n",

      "Mom, I don't think this will fool anybody.\n",
      "We can't take his money.\n",
      "Putting away groceries -- it's like unwrapping presents from yourself. Fruit roll-ups for Bart... beer roll-ups for Homer...\n",
      "Homer... Homer...\n",
      "AND THEY SHUT DOWN THE THINKHOLE...\n",
      "Oh my, I hope that rug was Scotchguarded.\n",
      "It's okay, Bart. This track has been abandoned since nineteen -- uh-oh.\n",
      "Hello, I'd like to talk to Dr. Monroe.\n",
      "I shouted until I was hoarse, but they couldn't hear me.\n",
      "What the... Oh, you want a rock fight, eh?\n",
      "It's mac and cheese from the school cafeteria. The blandest food known to man.\n",
      "I know that I got you mad once in a while...\n",
      "Oh c'mon... Mr. Burns is way more selfish.\n",
      "Man, a lion would not want to see that on his x-ray!\n",

      "Here she is. And look how big she's gotten.\n",
      "Oh, I can't believe...\n",
      "Please stop doing that.\n",
      "A banana!\n",
      "Indestructible...\n",
      "Hey, Moe. Beer me!\n",
      "Well of course. Wait a minute. This is to adopt two of your kids.\n",
      "Luxury? This thermostat is just painted on.\n",
      "Oh yes, you do. You just don't know it. The memory of a million drop-stitches flows in your veins.\n",
      "Oh, not bad. I'm starting to get the hang of the floor waxer.\n",
      "It's fun, but not as fun.\n",
      "But how?\n",
      "No, I will not pay you five hundred dollars for sex!!\n",
      "Mom, I'm glad you brought me here, but isn't it more important for a woman to be smart and powerful than beautiful?\n",
      "Well, some general-interest magazines would be nice.\n",
      "Unfortunately, son, we Simpsons sometimes have to bend the rules a little in order to hold our own.\n",
      "Hey, why don't we walk over to Grampa's and cheer up the old folks? That'll make us feel better.\n",
      "Oh, here we go with the add ons. No thanks.\n",
      "Now get to school, boy.\n",
      "My first credit card! Wow, the numbers are all bumpy-like.\n",
      "I just don't want to be alone.\n",
      "All I see is a pole. Maybe the flag fell off.\n",
      "Homer, he cheated you.\n",
      "I'm sorry about your face, Moe.\n",
      "Mm-hm. Hey, why don't we do one of those craft kits Aunt Patty always gives us?\n",
      "Why won't you be art?!\n",
      "You're both coming home with us!\n",
      "I don't want to be Chesty LaRue or Busty St. Claire!\n",
      "You said he went bowling!\n",
      "Gee, I thought you'd be some kind of creep. But you're actually a perfectly normal-looking--\n",
      "I knew we should have gone to the bird sanctuary.\n",
      "And it was a baby ox.\n",
      "Not my fault! Act of God! Act of God!\n",
      "Aw, Uncle Homer. Ned, since you've let me spend time with your family, I want you to get to know my family.\n",
      "Why you little...\n",
      "All right, Lou! To freedom! Lou?\n",
      "I have a favor to ask: please shut this place down and move away from Springfield.\n",
      "Marge! Lisa! Maggie! Let's do this out in the yard where the neighbors can see!\n",
      "Oh, it's for my Junior Achievers Club. We're trying to earn money by recycling.\n",
      "Noooo!!\n",
      "Now as you all know, Springfield's 200th birthday is only a week away. Every class will do its part to make our local bicentennial just as memorable as our National Bicentennial. Of course, you children are too young to remember that -- with the possible exception of Kearney.\n",
      "Well, I guess you and I are in charge now, Bart. But if we split the chores, I'm sure we can... what are you doing?!\n",
      "Hoo mama! This is finally really happening. After years of disappointments with get-rich-quick-schemes, I know I'm gonna get rich with this scheme! And quick!\n",
      "But, Dad, it's barbaric! How does killing a deer make you more of a man?\n",
      "A little?\n",
      "Oh my God, the hamsters!\n",
      "Yeah, well, if you're sure that'll help...\n",
      "All those women are so impressive.\n",

      "They mushed it all out of shape.\n",
      "What kind of pencil do we take again?\n",
      "I said NOW!\n",
      "They were the children's idea. I tried to stop them.\n",
      "Say, how's tomorrow for you?\n",
      "Y- No.\n",
      "Okay, okay... You want a shrimp cocktail?\n",
      "Take that, vile fiend!\n",
      "Yeah, why would you play chess through the mail when you can play chess through the internet, or preferably, not play chess at all?\n",
      "Come along, Adil.\n",
      "No Lis, I've got my eyes on the prize: the hood ornament I desperately want. For reasons I can no longer remember. The only thing stopping me is those lights.\n",
      "Ooh, I like this.\n",
      "That last one looked kinda good.\n",
      "You can bring a bag of ice.\n",
      "That's a brilliant idea. Those TV writers are geniuses!\n",
      "So, how 'bout a movie tomorrow night?\n",
      "Eight.\n",
      "What? Why?\n",
      "What a crazy room. There's no Albuquerque Isotopes. It's the Springfield... Ohhhh.\n",
      "Of course I don't, but other people do!\n",

      "Uh-oh.\n",
      "I think we're in the clear.\n",
      "Woo-hoo! Woo-hoo!\n",

      "Oh sure... it's sorta on my way home. I can check up on the old girl. She probably landed a job at some fancy-schmancy prep school.\n",

      "Splendid! Now, let's see how I'm faring on the jumping box.\n",
      "No! Now, look, son, we all know that usually when you bug me like this, I give in, so I'm not mad at you for trying. It shows you've been paying attention. But we all know I'm not gonna give you a hundred dollars. Now are you gonna stop bugging me?\n",
      "It's easier. Duh.\n",
      "Twenty on this one, my good man.\n",
      "Homer, with all the things you've done -- go into space, attend clown college, join the Navy -- I never thought you'd join the Army!\n",
      "Calm down there, 'Pu and She-Pu. You can use the restroom.\n",
      "Um... I think he should have to take a different oath.\n",
      "Hey, we could have tea in my treehouse.\n",
      "Why don't you come inside and we'll talk?\n",
      "Mom!\n",
      "Oh my God! Do you realize what this means?\n",
      "Yeah, Krabappel. They were naked in the closet together.\n",
      "Uh, nothin', Pop.\n",
      "He's really having trouble keeping his balance.\n",
      "Huh, when do we get paid?\n",

      "Arizona smells funny.\n",
      "Wait! I can't call Marge. It's our last day on earth together. I can't drag her into this mess. I know! I'll call Barney.\n",
      "Oh, this is perfect!\n",
      "Homer, that's enough.\n",
      "Well boy, you won. So I'm gonna live up to my side of the agreement. Here's your turtle, alive and well.\n",
      "I'm just glad it was you who brought us in, Nelson. Remember when we used to date? If you let me go, we can get back together. I never let you cherry bomb my Malibu Stacey -- I'll let you do it now.\n",
      "Well, you're not gonna find any here.\n",
      "We can take whatever we want, right?\n",
      "Ech! Think of how awful it would be for the poor midget inside...\n",
      "Maybe the person that turned your father in thought they were doing the right thing.\n",
      "There's something not quite right about this.\n",
      "You'd think so, but no.\n",
      "Zo-rrooo!\n",
      "All right, tell me when I hit the sweet spot.\n",
      "Oh? Well, I've always admired your tart honesty and ability to be personally offended by broad social trends.\n",
      "Hey, you easy. Now, get off my property! Off!\n",
      "That might work.\n",
      "Just buy it. You don't have to rationalize everything.\n",
      "Wow, your friend did something I could never do.\n",
      "Me and my big... letter writing pen!\n",
      "Aww. Tomorrow we were gonna find out who the dish ran away with.\n",
      "Finally, on a personal note, Mrs. Krabappel and I are to be joined in holy wedlock...this Saturday. We'll be honeymooning at Lake Shelbyville Lodge, Cabin Thirty-two, Room Three. And we do not wish to be disturbed.\n",
      "Don't you want to be happy, Abe? Admit who you are, a wonderful gay man!\n",

      "It could save lives!\n",
      "You're on your own.\n",
      "Here's my mask!\n",
      "Why don't you have dinner with us tonight?\n",
      "Because somehow you realized I was a good guy after all?\n",
      "Fas-ter.\n",
      "Not my concern!\n",
      "I can't just sit here watching this junk.\n",
      "Cherry cordials, sir.\n",
      "Really? Now? I have two pizzas coming. I wanted to see who would get here first.\n",
      "And I have to admit, it's a pretty good life.\n",
      "Oh, Homie, aren't they adorable?\n",
      "It's okay when you're in love. And married. To the sweetest guy in the world.\n",
      "There were so many things I wanted to do in life that I never got a chance to do: doctor , safecracker , stethoscope sales lady ... none came to pass. But the thing I really wanted to be, ever since I was little, was a ballerina!\n",
      "Wait just a minute.\n",
      "Already taken care of.\n",
      "Oh, Santa's Little Helper, I was crazy to give you up for another dog. What have I done to you?\n",
      "Flanders, I've come to forgive you.\n",
      "Stop kicking me!\n",
      "And I'd also like to know why your hand is in that cast.\n",
      "You know, with the way you're treating me, why should I protect you?\n",
      "I don't care who started it. I don't ever want to see you two fighting like that ever again. We love you both. You're not in competition with each other. Repeat. You are not in competition with each other.\n",

      "Mom, put your glasses on.\n",
      "They always told me I was gonna destroy the family, but I never believed it.\n",
      "This way!\n",
      "Oh, Homer, Mr. Burns just said he liked it. Once.\n",
      "Hmmm... still got it!\n",
      "What?\n",
      "...initial the radon disclosure... and done.\n",
      "Purple drapes! All my life I've wanted purple drapes!\n",
      "I'll really miss you guys. I'll never forget the three activities we did together.\n",
      "Yeah, just have fun -- Dad would.\n",
      "...Fading, fading, gone.\n",
      "I must warn you that once this next tape starts, it will not stop. Because that button is broken.\n",

      "I know of them.\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "The secret ingredient is blood.\n",
      "I feel so helpless. What if something happens to them?\n",
      "Dear Lord, in your infinite wisdom, you know the number to call when you need a plow is KLONDIKE 5-3226.\n",
      "Thanks, Mr. Teeny!\n",
      "Cool. I'll give you ten bucks for that.\n",
      "Well where is he now? Maybe I can help you two patch up your differences.\n",
      "You know what's great about you, Marge? After all these years you can still shinny up the donut, and then pull me up after you.\n",
      "Your dad's been in the closet for so long, he probably doesn't know how tolerant society's become. They even had a gay float in the Pride Parade last year.\n",
      "But I want to learn a dance I can use in real life, like the Tango de la Muerte.\n",
      "See, Marge. Problems will work themselves out if you just leave them alone.\n",
      "Oh, I wrote down what I was gonna say on a card. Stupid thing must have fallen out of my pocket.\n",
      "They got me with their legal mumbo-jumbo.\n",
      "What's the word I'm searching for? Uh... yeah! A trip to the alma mater might really rekindle my love of gettin' people loaded.\n",
      "You're right, Lis. I can suck up to him like the religious people suck up to God.\n",
      "No, I'm no-ot! Yes I am. The Bloody Hangman walks on his stubby bone feet through the plague-ridden streets of London...\n",
      "Marge, that was a joke!\n",
      "Okay. Now, I wanted to paint fresh fruit, but the prison cafeteria would only give me sauerkraut.\n",
      "Hmm, still half an hour till dinner. Oh, well...\n",
      "Thank you.\n",
      "All right, I know how to handle this. Just use a little reverse psychology. Let's go, Marge. Leave the baby with his little crib.\n",
      "Well, I have to coordinate, don't I?\n",
      "Balderdash. This is the silliest load of... Ooh, look at it fly. Whee! Look at me, Smithers, I feel practically superduperfragicaliexpiala-dohhhh!\n",
      "Oh, Lisa, maybe you're right. Maybe you're wrong. The important thing is Veterans deserve a day to honor them.\n",
      "I'll save you, Lisa! Whoa.\n",
      "Hey, what smells so good?\n",
      "Uh oh.\n",
      "This family has had a lot of hoods put over their heads.\n",
      "Poor Aunt Hortense... woo-hoo... woo-hoo...\n",
      "I can't believe the man who agreed to follow my daughter around -- for money -- would turn out to be a dirt bag.\n",
      "So, uh, what kind of adventure you gonna be involved in tonight, Homer?\n",
      "Half-brother and half-sister?\n",
      "Yes, he's raking leaves.\n",
      "What is perception?\n",
      "All good.\n",
      "Who told you that?\n",
      "It's a party, Marge. It doesn't have to make sense.\n",
      "Keep your voices down, boys. We didn't come this far to get found out.\n",
      "We have roots here, Homer. We have friends and family and library cards... Bart's lawyer is here.\n",
      "I was right.\n",
      "You talk like my ass plays harmonica.\n",
      "Marge, Marge, look!\n",
      "Don't drink my loved ones!\n",
      "Huh?\n",
      "Bart, no, it's Valentine's Day.\n",
      "Okay... maybe I can pay for the cruise. Let's see how much it costs for a cabin on a low deck, no porthole, group Z lifeboat access... It's still a ton of money.\n",
      "I'd better join a gym before I go from hippy to hippo.\n",
      "The queen's private surgeonnn!\n",
      "I can't believe it! I've done all my housework and it's only 9:30! Well, better go upstairs and make sure the beds are still made.\n",
      "Why not?\n",
      "You were never going to apologize!\n",
      "Oh yeah... art.\n",
      "Where's your father with those pacifiers?\n",
      "Squiggy?\n",
      "What I wouldn't give for something to interrupt this awkward moment.\n",
      "Hand me that saw, Marge!\n",
      "What does that mean?\n",
      "Who do you have next period?\n",
      "Hi guys. Hi Otto. Move over. I'm driving.\n",
      "Marge! I'm glad you came. There's a kegger down the hall. We can go as soon as I desecrate this corpse.\n",
      "I don't hand out candy, you son of a Gritch.\n",
      "Edna Krabappel, please report to the principal's arms.\n",
      "Can't talk now, Flanders. I've got a class to teach.\n",
      "Two sets of twins and a triplet!\n",
      "Mister, you are grounded!\n",
      "Sara, I'm sorry, but I can't move to Hollywood. Heck, even Dollywood's too far out for me. Too many people appreciating it ironically.\n",
      "Yeah. Just look at 'em over there...\n",
      "Sure do miss that laugh.\n",
      "It's your life.\n",
      "Oh, my.\n",

      "Ohh, and a very manly one, if I may say so, m'lord.\n",
      "He wouldn't sign my ball.\n",
      "Hey, Otto. Hey, Ottoman.\n",
      "Hey Kozlov! Aim for the five hole! He's got an opening the size of Red Square.\n",
      "Heads up.\n",
      "Did I say any moment?\n",
      "Stay out of my boxes!\n",

      "The Sprinkle King, Sprinkle Queen, and Deluxe Sprinkle King are the Simon and Garfunkel plus one of hose-nozzle dispersal arrays. Observe.\n",
      "How cute.\n",

      "Oh, great. And I just got all that gum outta my armpits.\n",
      "About Virgil.\n",
      "Looks like you guys are on the mend.\n",

      "Marge? Can you come in here? We need to talk.\n",
      "We've gotta clean this up before mom gets back.\n",
      "That's not the idea at all. Okay, well this story isn't ideal, I've never told it to you before.\n",
      "Ew.\n",
      "She sure did. Now if Lisa is finished with her shenanigans, I'll tell you why I didn't show up...\n",

      "In a way. But I also remembered some other stuff... like my bike that was stolen in third grade. Plus the baldness.\n",
      "Well, he shouldn't kill birds. It's not right!\n",
      "And I want to let you!!\n",
      "Maybe people don't want an eight-year-old babysitter, honey. Parents need to be sure their sitter can handle anything that might happen. That's why they hire teenagers.\n",
      "You ugly, hate-filled man.\n",
      "Look, here's the box for my Pitchback. If I still had it, I could put it in here.\n",
      "No, no, your jobs are safe. They'll just be done by someone else in another country.\n",
      "...like a whole lotta money!\n",
      "Bart?\n",
      "Gotcha.\n",
      "There's no Councilman Les Wynan.\n",
      "So Patty, tell me more about your trip to Egypt.\n",
      "Okay... activate my level seven power stones... wield the orb of oblivion... And zap!\n",
      "Oh, so now it's we, eh.\n",
      "Carpool, Nelson!\n",
      "That was yesterday.\n",
      "Mom, please tell me I can go to Hell.\n",
      "Run!\n",
      "Here you go.\n",
      "Bart?\n",
      "Well, where do you think we are?\n",
      "No, no, and double-no! I haven't done any of those things, folks. You name it, I haven't done it!\n",
      "You mean I danced all by myself?\n",
      "Willie, I love your chaps.\n",
      "Marge, we can't be too careful. There are thieves everywhere, and I'm not talking about the small, forgivable stuff.\n",
      "A beached whale.\n",
      "I don't know, it's awfully expensive to fly to Brazil.\n",
      "Yes. He can take a simple, everyday thing like eating a bicycle and make it funny.\n",
      "Well duh! He's breathtaking, but Bart has inner beauty... like you'd find in a rodent.\n",
      "Marge, this time I'm going to give you the wedding you deserve. Let's get out of here!\n",
      "If Bart stays home, I'm going to school.\n",
      "Herman, your beef is with me. Leave the girl out of this.\n",
      "He's taking the elephant instead of the money.\n",
      "Seventy-six point two?! But I'm already thirty-eight point one! I've wasted half my life!\n",
      "No, he hasn't. He's more the same than ever. And I know where the evidence is. There's only one place it could possibly be.\n",
      "... and our beautiful baby. My daughter, Lisa -- I.Q. 156.\n",
      "All right, but I get to poke you with a stick.\n",
      "Maggie, I'm trying to watch TV. Put that moldy old bear down.\n",
      "Why aren't I going to Oslo? The Nobel Prizes are my freakin' thing! But no -- Bart gets everything because he's the oldest and he's a boy. And Maggie gets what's ever left over because she's the youngest and she's a baby. Meanwhile, I'll just stand and wave to people going to better places.\n",
      "Heh-heh, good one, Krusty.\n",
      "Wait... I finally get what you're saying. Fracking is great. But the only place it should ever happen is in other people's towns!\n",
      "Ooh!\n",
      "Simpson! Let's move on now, Mother, shall we?\n",
      "Ew, your arm! It's got extra corners!\n",
      "Hey, the dog smells something!\n",
      "No, the stupidest thing would be doing it backwards.\n",
      "I love kissing you. I never want to knock it off.\n",
      "That thing got picture-in-picture?\n",
      "Suckers.\n",
      "Hey, no pain, no gain.\n",
      "The furnace?\n",
      "Look, honey, I clipped on my tie all by myself.\n",
      "... shake hands?... stay!\n",
      "Put my hand on her knee.\n",
      "--alia! America, Australia, Ameri-- ow!\n",
      "Huh?\n",
      "Oh, thank God. It's only Grampa.\n",
      "Bart, go to your room!\n",
      "Grampa?\n",
      "It's not fair. Your father always gets to have such exciting adventures. Maybe it's time we took a walk on the wild side...\n",
      "Hey Ma, our crap shack's going to hell.\n",
      "People called him the sixth Simpson. Not sure why.\n",
      "I can't let the boy see me skipping work.\n",
      "Hey Lis.\n",
      "These have pleats...\n",
      "Hey, what's the matter, son?\n",
      "No problem.\n",
      "Um, I'm sorry, the car did not meet my eco-concerns. Can I have my prize now?\n",
      "See you again?\n",
      "I'll tell you when we get there. Go back to your smell game.\n",
      "The first part is always green, but it turns red.\n",
      "Relax, Homer, I keep tellin' ya, you're my guest.\n",
      "And when you're done, here are the keys to your new shack.\n",
      "This yolk-separating camera-hog was supposed to call you and say happy birthday! From her show!\n",
      "I'll take that as a compliment. So, will you go out with me? Please say oui.\n",
      "My tattered rags are caught on your coffee table.\n",
      "Chosen for what, oh mighty gherkin?\n",
      "I mean the one at the house.\n",
      "Stupid ice. I always knew I would die caked in something.\n",
      "Marge, I've got to get her a pony. When I look in Lisa's eyes, I don't see love anymore.\n",
      "Look, I want a cup.\n",
      "Woo hoo! We can gamble!\n",
      "Yeah, I'm bored too.\n",
      "C'mon, Apu. Make your move.\n",
      "Yes!\n",
      "Why didn't you call me?\n",
      "Whuh?\n",
      "I'll teach you to beat up yester-me!\n",
      "Nuclear power. I make money using my brain... not sticking a pole in the ground and praying for goo.\n",
      "Hmf. All right, if you're so smart, tell me who I selected to be lunch room monitor.\n",
      "Oh, Flanders, I promise I'll never abuse our friendship again.\n",
      "Great gig.\n",
      "Look, this church is our only option. Don't you kids want to live here?\n",
      "Make it, make it, make it, make it.\n",
      "A lot of you would think I was crazy if I did this.\n",
      "Ralph, I will play you for that card.\n",
      "Heel -- toe. Heel -- toe. Heel -- toe.\n",
      "Can't they get a pole for that sign?\n",
      "It's kinder never to tell them.\n",
      "What's my name?! What color is the sky?! What of donuts? WHAT?! For the love of God, tell meeeee!!!\n",
      "No! No, I was talkin' to Lisa back there, we both agreed you killed.\n",
      "SO I THREW YOU A FANCY BANQUET / AND NOW YOU CAN'T STAY MAD / HOW 'BOUT A MAKE-UP SNUGGLE? / IT WOULD BE SO RAD.\n",
      "All right. I'll do it for you.\n",
      "Hey!\n",
      "Mom, this is for you: 15 pounds of\n",
      "Now, really I hardly think the children's appearance should --\n",
      "Dr. Hibbert.\n",
      "Look at the bright side, Marge. When I die, you can mourn me from the bathroom. That's multi-tasking.\n",
      "Well, surely there's room in this town for two well-meaning juvenile associations.\n",
      "You did it, baby. You promised no fun and you delivered.\n",
      "Okay, I've set my trap. Now to scatter my cheese cubes and the rats will come. Condos! Affordable condos! Bail-jumpers welcome!\n",
      "I never stopped telling you.\n",
      "This horse is pretty fast. Maybe we can race him.\n",
      "That's ridiculous. If I had set up those dominoes, I'd be wearing my special domino-setting up kneepads.\n",
      "Well said! If we all stand together, Nelson's helpless. Hell no, we won't show! Hell no, we won't show!\n",
      "Don't leave me hangin', Greenspan.\n",
      "Madre de Dios! The legends were true!\n",
      "Run!\n",
      "Bart, what are you doing in my room?\n",
      "Oh, forget it. Bart, don't waste your money on me.\n",
      "Don't worry -- Ray'll be back any minute.\n",
      "Let's try some oil of Lorenzo. And, uh, what's keeping Joan Rivers alive?\n",
      "If it's important, they'll call back.\n",
      "What's your problem?\n",
      "No talking.\n",
      "I'm trying, Mother. It's hard!\n",
      "Oh, yeah? We'll just see about that.\n",
      "Lisa, because of your outstanding score on yesterday's big test, you're being immediately moved up to... the third grade!\n",
      "Uh, over here.\n",
      "How about Benihana, where dinner is the show?\n",
      "Lisa! I am nice.\n",
      "And a bottle of aspirin, please.\n",
      "Is he gonna be okay?\n",
      "All right, all right.\n",
      "Get your own family, Moe.\n",
      "That's okay, I was just thinking about Sybil Danning.\n",
      "Of course you do. Dylan's a... Hm... let me check the invitation...\n",
      "Not real.\n",
      "Oh, Homer, be reasonable.\n",
      "Who wants feet steak?\n",
      "That quick talking is never a good sign.\n",
      "You're right.\n",
      "Marge have you seen my lunch box?\n",
      "I'm on my way!\n",
      "But the avatar looks just like you!\n",
      "Saturday night? I'm not even sure my sisters will be available.\n",
      "Yeah, he was a great dog.\n",
      "Hm, the water's off. I'll use my eye to see what the trouble is.\n",
      "Sorry, Ralph.\n",
      "Homer Sim-- Uh, Max Power.\n",
      "Dohhh! Sauce, cheese, topping!\n",
      "I'll play it later.\n",
      "Hey, hey, stop it!\n",
      "Hey, Dad, gimme fifty bucks. I gotta buy some things. Uh, better make it a hundred.\n",
      "Okay, okay. I'll be nicer to the dude. I've just never really been a dog person.\n",
      "Can you still see the ball, Bart?\n",
      "Maybe. I don't watch him every minute. But what I am sure of is, we're getting cable for free.\n",
      "I can't excape Lisa, our little walking libary!\n",
      "Wow, I can't believe I'm here. The place where magic is made.\n",
      "Maggie!\n",
      "Oh, thank you, thank you, thank you! You wonderful man!\n",
      "Any suggestions?\n",
      "Yeah, so, uh, I'm going out to rehearse... the revue.\n",
      "Aw, what do you know?\n",
      "I can explain, Marge! Please let me explain! Oh, why won't you let me explain!!!\n",
      "Oh ohhhh boy, oh oh oh oh boy, oh boy.\n",
      "Ooo, classy.\n",
      "Now if you want to be the life of the party like Lenny here, just place your order for this hilarious novelty item.\n",
      "Take your time!\n",
      "I don't know, Marge. Trying is the first step toward failure.\n",
      "Daddy.\n",
      "No problem.\n",
      "Number one, the Kingston Trio. Number two...\n",
      "The Rememberererer?\n",
      "Can you paint me knocking out Larry Holmes?\n",
      "My pockets hurt.\n",
      "The pig is in the poke.\n",
      "Okay, Stupid Flanders, first I want you to kill that guy at the ice cream parlor who gave Homer Simpson a cone that had a little air in it.\n",
      "Yes. I am in flavor country.\n",
      "I'm gonna get real help. Just try to keep her wet.\n",
      "I didn't think it would ever come, but it did!\n",
      "Where'd he go?\n",
      "I've got to keep trying! Or I could just move that picture. No! The picture looked good where it was. Boy, drag me back outside.\n",
      "Okay, sweetie, open those baby blacks!\n",
      "How can you write such horrible things about me?\n",
      "That doesn't sound like me. Well, I suppose if this doesn't work out you can always go back to the plant.\n",
      "I did.\n",
      "They're passes to a test screening of a new movie starring Mel Gibson!\n",
      "I'm gonna swim nekkid.\n",
      "We're out of milk.\n",
      "I'm missing the Cook-Off! It's going on right now and I'm missin' it!\n",
      "Lemme just finish this last lobster tail and raspberry torte.\n",
      "Take us out first! Anyone can start a family! These days, no one can find a job!\n",
      "Up-up-up-up. Don't answer me now. Relax, talk it over with the missus, soak in the opulence of your surroundings and dream of what might be. Smithers, let's go powder my nose.\n",
      "That's odd -- there doesn't seem to be anyone here.\n",
      "You mean I get 5% off on everything in the store just because I look like... I mean, just because I am Krusty the clown?\n",
      "Hey, hey, hey!\n",
      "I'm dead.\n",
      "But I want to go.\n",
      "Kids? Kids?\n",
      "You're right, I am. Help me, Marge. What do I do to be a good guy?\n",
      "That is so cool. Bart, open the door.\n",
      "No! My friends! Stop!\n",
      "Uh-oh. Almost forgot to lock the doors.\n",
      "Yeah. After you were so mean to us.\n",
      "Oh. See, here's the problem, Ralph. You have several threes.\n",
      "Gimme a beer and a shot of whiskey!\n",
      "You're being ridiculous.\n",
      "I'm glad you're back, Dad. It's hard to sleep with one un-kissed cheek.\n",
      "I'M A WALKIN' DOWN THE STREET, GONNA OPEN MOE'S BAR / I'M A SINGIN' WHAT I'M THINKIN' / HEY, LOOK AT THAT DOG.\n",
      "No, me!\n",
      "Aw, Mom. Can't we just grab a burger and... Only four of us? Who escaped?\n",
      "So thirsty... Eh. What're you gonna do?\n",
      "Uh-oh. There's already an on-set romance.\n",
      "Sneh.\n",
      "I didn't tell you to quit your job.\n",
      "You think you're cool because you buy a five hundred dollar phone with a picture of a fruit on it?! Well, guess what? They cost eight bucks to make and I pee on every one!\n",
      "Mm! Shoo! Shoo, fly!\n",
      "Yay!\n",
      "Your Dad's McBain?\n",
      "Uh, hello? Why am I Mr. Sparkle?\n",
      "Boy, when Lisa comes in, I want you to make a big fuss over how she looks.\n",
      "Woo hoo! Cheap meat!\n",
      "Look, Janey, cupcakes.\n",
      "WHEN I WAS 17.\n",
      "And this Slinky... these things are fun for about two seconds.\n",
      "Can we cuddle for a little while?\n",
      "Did you hear that, Marge? She called me a baboon! The stupidest, ugliest, smelliest ape of them all!\n",
      "Sorry, Marge. Pinchy got all dirty in the yard chasing birds. But don't worry. I put him in a nice hot bath.\n",
      "Bart, how many hours a day do you watch TV?\n",
      "I'm a latchkey kid.\n",
      "Hmm... Back yard, back yard, toilet, ocean, don't know, back yard, Flanders' mailbox, Lenny's freezer, tire fire.\n",
      "Well, you could give them healthier snacks... theme days...\n",
      "You're not as stupid as you look... or sound... or our best testing indicates.\n",
      "I wish I'd married Lenny and his friend!\n",
      "Wow. Now that I know all this, isn't there any way to change the future?\n",
      "Take it outside, Simpson. I'm male modeling.\n",
      "Wrinkly gibberish?\n",
      "That does it. Children, get dressed. We're leaving.\n",
      "Nice one, Homer.\n",
      "Homie, wake up.\n",
      "Ahh! How did I lose my passion for the job? When I was in bartending school, I thought I had the world by the jigger.\n",
      "Hmmm, I can feel three kinds of softness.\n",
      "Bart, what are you doing up here? Everybody's worried.\n",
      "Your sax! Thank you so much!\n",
      "Why hasn't anyone called?\n",
      "Now, I appreciate that, honey, but we need one hundred and fifty dollars here.\n",
      "Let us through!\n",
      "Let's do it, Homer!\n",
      "Then what happened?\n",
      "Mom! Lisa's growing!\n",
      "Uh... you know it's a boat, right?\n",
      "Hm...\n",
      "There comes a time to beat the crap out of childish things!\n",
      "Keep my tail right here in this jar.\n",
      "People, people, no rough-housing on the monkey bars. You there, tuck in your shirt. Watch it, I saw that.\n",
      "And I'm starting right now. No more lousy pajamas!\n",
      "Ooh, a salute to brunch! Wave to brunch, Maggie!\n",
      "Homer, our house is on fire! Help me save the children!\n",
      "Son, menopause is when the stork that brings babies gets shot by drunken hunters.\n",
      "The World's Best Jacket! If I had this it would show everybody... show everybody!\n",
      "It's for you, Marge. From merry old England.\n",
      "Oh. That guy.\n",
      "Leave me alone!\n",
      "Yep. Our family is as functional as all get out.\n",
      "Where'd you get that dress?\n",
      "Homer, I'd like you to forgive me for doing the right thing.\n",
      "What happened with the E.M.P.?\n",
      "Surprise! I redecorated!\n",
      "You've been drinking today, haven't you?\n",
      "Do they do any other tricks?\n",
      "I just want you to know that I love you, Dad.\n",
      "Oh, gimme a break, Marge.\n",
      "Dear Lord, please make Homer's blows precise and deadly with a minimum of pain. Oh, and forgive me for those impure thoughts I had about the girl on the raisin box.\n",
      "That could be Lisa!\n",
      "But breaking your jaw has made you so sweet. Maybe we can go.\n",
      "Dude...\n",
      "Looking for something?\n",
      "I retract my statement.\n",
      "Continue the research.\n",
      "Here's our house... a rainbow... a white hand shaking a black hand...\n",
      "Here, let me wrap this wet towel around your head to cool you off.\n",
      "Can we at least get some French fries?\n",
      "Fox had an endless supply of clever slogans, man.\n",
      "That's right, Mister Tough Guy can't handle a little penicillin. Oh, and look at this. We can't even pay our bills and they're drinking Royal Crown Cola.\n",
      "C'mon, man. At least listen to what I have to say.\n",
      "Wait! I haven't chosen my mix-in!\n",
      "Homer, send these people home. This housewarming party's been going on for two days.\n",
      "You? Don't make me laugh! You couldn't--\n",
      "What... But... Marge, it's broad daylight and there's cops everywhere!\n",
      "Why is the TV back on? What happened to the videogame?\n",
      "This doesn't look easy, but I'll bet it is.\n",
      "I did.\n",
      "Here it comes...\n",
      "Get what?\n",
      "Homer! You have to stop dropping your pants for everyone who claims they're a doctor!\n",
      "Today was fun.\n",
      "What's the matter, boy?\n",
      "Geoffrey Chaucer?! What are you doing here?\n",
      "Dad, are you licking toads?\n",
      "You jumped bail, Homer. I gotta bring you in.\n",
      "They all make good points.\n",
      "Oh Marge, I'm just being polite.\n",
      "TOORA LOORA LOORA\n",
      "These stink lines stand for dedication, caring, and for letting me drink coffee in class. Way to go, Edna!\n",
      "What's the first thing you're gonna make in your new kitchen?\n",
      "So, Mother Simpson, where did your new-found sense of irresponsibility take you?\n",
      "Right after I blow up one thing.\n",
      "Well, one of us made some money. I sold a guy our spare tire.\n",
      "Where's Maggie?\n",
      "Well, if anyone saves my Homie's life, they get a free meal. Which actually comes up about once a week.\n",
      "Well, this story begins in this unforgettable spring of 1983: Ms. Pac-man struck a blow for women's rights... a young Joe Piscopo taught us how to laugh. Before Lisa was born, we lived in a tiny apartment on the Lower East side of Springfield.\n",
      "Rough day, Apu. Pump me a Squishee and don't spare the syrup.\n",
      "If you're gonna get snippy, I'll take my business elsewhere.\n",
      "Meyerhof lifters...\n",
      "Marge, in a world gone mad, only a lunatic is truly insane.\n",
      "Springfield High football rules!\n",
      "Well, I gotta hand it to you, Homer. You're really brave to go through with this operation.\n",
      "Homer, you brought us to this horrible place on purpose?\n",
      "Because we send them money?\n",
      "Are you ready to laugh?\n",
      "I'm gonna put a spell on you! Yes I am, my tuna-breath familiar.\n",
      "That's right. Over the homes of poor people.\n",
      "You look at this table and what do you see? Just a table. Now, a creative person, like me, looks at this table and sees all kinds of creative things -- but no tables.\n",
      "Dance with me, please. I need to zing my sister.\n",
      "Yeah. Among other things, apes can't get into heaven.\n",
      "Boy, where are my zydeco records?\n",
      "Lisa, Lisa! I think you're right about Dad. Something's very, very wrong here.\n",
      "Quiet, the commercial's on! If we don't watch these, it's like we're stealing TV.\n",
      "But why, Mr. McGwire?\n",
      "I'm writing a letter to President Clinton about that travesty of a band contest. As a fellow sax player, I'm sure he'll be outraged.\n",
      "Why not?\n",
      "Hello? Homer? Where are you? You promised you were going to have a tea party with Maggie.\n",
      "Well... whatever's easier.\n",
      "Okay. You got my attention.\n",

      "Uncle Sam? Let me play this backwards.\n",
      "Precious Venus...\n",

      "Wow, that's really lazy.\n",
      "Sir, I am in your debt.\n",
      "I'd smash 'em all for one lousy beer.\n",

      "Look at that, kids! No fighting, no yelling...\n",
      "Look at me! You did help me, by allowing me to inappropriately focus eight years of rage and rejection on you. It was like a great sneeze. And now I can say what's good about me. And I can say it as Lisa Simpson! Just not that loud.\n",

      "I got your letter, Jesus and I'm coming as fast as I can.\n",
      "Okay. I'm not gonna give up. Solitude never hurt anyone. Emily Dickinson lived alone and she wrote some of the most beautiful poetry the world has ever known! And went crazy as a loon.\n",

      "What guys? I wanna see the freaks.\n",
      "Da-ad.\n",
      "No, Dad, no. My point is you have to do something big and daring.\n",

      "Uh, excuse me, sir, I think there's been a mistake.\n",
      "Well, it doesn't matter how you feel inside, you know. It's what shows up on the surface that counts. That's what my mother taught me. Take all your bad feelings and push them down, all the way down, past your knees, until you're almost walking on them. And then you'll fit in, and you'll be invited to parties, and boys will like you... and happiness will follow.\n",
      "Don't worry, we're not evil spirits.\n",
      "Homie, I love you, and I'm glad we're finally using our wedding china, but when you're helping to pick the next leader of the free world...\n",
      "Sorry, Marge. I'm afraid this gets my lowest rating ever, seven thumbs up.\n",

      "Hey, what's this?\n",
      "Um... some other time, maybe. Today I'm just hanging out at home.\n",

      "Or the way Dad used to call the radio station with fake traffic tips?\n",
      "I wanna go on the Yard-work Simulator!\n",
      "Wow! My mother the actress. I feel like Lucie Arnaz-Luckinbill.\n",
      "Fat Tony?\n",

      "You are not bringing that thing home.\n",
      "Oh, Smithers, when you look at me with those puppy dog eyes... all right.\n",
      "Yeah, yeah. Anyway, you promised to take us to the lake.\n",

      "No. Not unless you kill your family.\n",
      "No.\n",
      "Goodnight, Teddy Bear. Goodnight, Justin Timberwolf. Goodnight, Bedtime Krusty.\n",
      "Lucky parameciums.\n",

      "Mr. and Mrs. Van Houten!\n",
      "Oh, Maggie will do just fine. She'll have plenty of money, 'cause she'll marry a grocer...\n",
      "Awww.\n",
      "I figured if one six-pack holder will catch one fish, a million sewn together will catch a million fish. Watch.\n",

      "We need money fast!\n",

      "This house is haunted!\n",
      "Oh man, this is the greatest night of my life. If my Dad could see this he'd be so mad.\n",
      "Thanks, but lowering your voice and standing on paint cans doesn't make you man enough to be my dad.\n",
      "Now that's the Marge I married.\n",

      "Now get lost!\n",
      "... Nine... ten...\n",
      "Oh.\n",

      "Is it used?\n",
      "Yeah, it's tough being man of the house. You left some big underpants to fill. I didn't know they made Underoos in size fifty-two.\n",
      "Man, those cons love Krusty. Inside every hardened criminal beats the heart of a ten-year-old boy.\n",
      "Get back to work!\n",
      "All right, Simpson, be honest with me. Is it actually possible to win this game?\n",
      "We had one date. And you were not a gentleman.\n",
      "I've got it! It's in the bag!\n",
      "Prancer...\n",
      "I agree, but how?\n",
      "... So I sent Luke's sister down the wrong trail and... Hey! Where'd all this water come from? There used to be a trail here! And there used to be a beaver dam there.\n",
      "Let's try the red one again.\n",
      "We are all here because drinkin' in our bars is down. Mom and Pop bartenders can't compete with big box stores like Booze Barn and Hooch City.\n",
      "Yeah, all right. It'll cover the gravy stains.\n",
      "Hmm, this must be some sort of cafetorium.\n",
      "No, really.\n",
      "O-o-o-ooooh booooyyyyy... We had the family version of a bromance going with our awesome neighbors, and you had to screw it up.\n",
      "What? It's not Magaggie's birthday? Oh.\n",
      "Dinner party at the neighbors'. At least I can drink.\n",
      "Penal.\n",
      "I won. Don't take that away from me.\n",
      "Wooo!!\n",
      "Quick, Bart, give me a kiss.\n",
      "Yaaaa...\n",
      "Haven't you heard? He's the new Homer.\n",
      "Okay, now!\n",
      "Uh yeah, I guess I could lose a few pounds. And I can be kind of thick sometimes.\n",
      "You know what Mom really loves? Julienne potatoes. And for dessert, peach crumble.\n",
      "Lisa, could you pass the salad?\n",
      "Hi, Nikki. I'm Bart. This situation, it's nuts, right?\n",
      "Okay, but if you really want to honk Skinner off, I suggest you attack the one thing he truly believes in.\n",
      "And vice versa.\n",
      "Mom, you can't possibly believe that.\n",
      "Woo hoo!\n",
      "Wait a minute, Bart.\n",
      "You're Darryl Strawberry.\n",
      "And the dog in the Coppertone ad? Same deal, Dad?\n",
      "Bart, what's wrong with you?\n",
      "Does a father have to explain? Let's just share your gift, okay?\n",
      "Also wrong.\n",
      "Good to see you. Glad you could make it.\n",
      "'CAUSE MOE'S A BIG JERK AND A SHE-MALE TOO!\n",
      "They have a lot of funny words for not-so-funny things.\n",
      "You mean I have pneumonia?\n",
      "Someone's coming!\n",
      "No thanks. But thanks.\n",
      "I don't even have a special tooth problem! This is just a routine check-up! The bib is choking me!\n",
      "Moderately wealthy?\n",
      "How's he doing?\n",
      "Hi, little fella. Got some nice juicy flies for ya.\n",
      "You know, if we get through to just that one little girl, it'll all be worth it.\n",
      "Homer! Homie? Hm... what he's typed will be a window into his madness.\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Ahoy hoy, St. Nick!\n",
      "Wow, Dad. You really threw a tantrum like a little sissy girl?\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "No, Marge. You're the most giving person I know. Besides, i gave them another gem child to sit on their precious throne.\n",
      "How did you survive?\n",
      "You don't know him. He lives in Russia.\n",
      "Exactly!\n",
      "Okay, so we have one thing in common. But you know what I hate? Drinking beer and watching TV.\n",
      "That's just you, Bart.\n",
      "What? Oh, yes. That fellow. Well, just put him somewhere out of the way and find that dog.\n",
      "Now I can show all of you what I've come to realize. The reason we're not allowed in the Forbidden Barn is because there is no inter-galactic spaceship! He's taken our money just so he can...build one hell of a spaceship!\n",
      "You're certainly in a good mood tonight, Dad.\n",
      "No they didn't. You just brought a bucket of chicken to church.\n",
      "It's your sister.\n",
      "He made it!\n",
      "Uh, yeah.\n",
      "Gotcha!\n",
      "Now that's what I call a snappy retort!\n",
      "You haven't heard the last of this!\n",
      "Mr. Burns...\n",
      "Big deal. It's just saltines and fig paste.\n",
      "You're the Hell's Satans? What a fun coincidence. My gang's name is also the...\n",
      "Alan Moore, Art Spiegelman... Oh, Dan Clowes!\n",
      "Hi, Homer.\n",
      "Bad baby!\n",
      "Our houses are the cheapest! The one next to me's been on sale forever! I see them lowering the price every morning when I go out to pee.\n",
      "Is that horse vacuuming?\n",
      "Ooh, I just finished my first paragraph. Spell check!\n",
      "Bart will give back the Malibu Stacy head you thought was lost.\n",
      "Well, it all starts when the nulecule comes out of its nest...\n",
      "Because you've already done it once.\n",
      "My God. I've created life!\n",
      "Bart! How many times have I told you not to bite your sist... Wait a minute! You are a vampire.\n",
      "What the heckaroonie is this, Mrs. Glick?\n",
      "Well, we'll see about that.\n",
      "Um... about how early press coverage of the bake sale is uniformly positive.\n",
      "You've said that three times already!\n",
      "Oh, we're never gonna get out of... Psst, cleaning lady. Would you let us out of here?\n",
      "Oh, come on, I've seen you cry a million times. You cry when you scrape your knee. You cry when they're out of chocolate milk. You cry when you're doing long division and you have a remainder left over.\n",
      "Police brutality! And chew-tality!\n",
      "I don't see any breasts.\n",
      "He thought that trip to the guillotine factory was just for fun. But it was the perfect place to shoot him.\n",
      "Well, that about does it for houses in this area...\n",
      "Oh! Oh! Block it.\n",
      "Bart, why are you still up?\n",
      "Thirty years! I'll never find him. I'm doomed to walk through this life alone. Oh brother, where art thou?!\n",
      "No. There's no way out.\n",
      "I wanna saunter!\n",
      "There are perfectly good answers to those questions, but they'll have to wait for another night. Now off to bed.\n",
      "Oh. Seriously, everyone says your parties rock.\n",
      "Check this out!\n",
      "Are you questioning my authority? Willie?\n",
      "I'm here to see Grampa.\n",
      "Marge, you can't go with me to Moe's. I mean, how would you like it if I came with you to your mother's?\n",
      "Hey!\n",
      "Like fun I don't. Marge, I'm never going to church again.\n",
      "DARTS AND MEATPIES, AND LAGER IN PINT GLASSES\n",
      "Bart, there's spiders in your hair.\n",
      "...And then they realized they were no longer little girls, they were little women.\n",
      "Eh, we could try it.\n",
      "Look at 'em, with their bright, airy narthex and light, flaky Eucharist. I wouldn't mind dipping my hand in their font.\n",
      "Can't you do anything? Surprise witnesses? Evidence tampering? Play the race card. Play it.\n",
      "Go nuts.\n",
      "There it is, boys, the championship trophy!\n",
      "Yeah, right. Like you're gonna let me go hungry. I'll be eatin' that pizza in five minutes.\n",
      "Dad, you're eating Dr. Phil!\n",
      "Then it's settled. The Simpsons are going to Brazil.\n",
      "Wow, All-Access. All-Access...\n",
      "Yes. I ate two grapes. Please charge me for them.\n",
      "Yeah, I have their baseball cards.\n",
      "We did it! You're in!\n",
      "Is anything wrong?\n",
      "We'll clean out those stupid Americans.\n",
      "I'm okay! And I found some gold!\n",
      "That's right, you're workin' in the kitchen. That's how our camp pays the bills.\n",

      "Look, everyone! Now that I'm a teacher, I've sewed patches on my elbows.\n",
      "Where's my elephant?!\n",
      "Mom! Mom! Wake up!\n",
      "Exactly.\n",
      "Mom, you're the greatest. Can I have this licorice?\n",
      "You know, I just got a little chill when you said my name.\n",
      "That is called parenting. I'm going to Moe's.\n",
      "All right, that's it, pull over.\n",
      "Oh, you mean Krusty the Clown?\n",
      "You name it, oh wise mountain ape.\n",

      "Hey.\n",

      "I know what I've got to do.\n",
      "Oops.\n",
      "Hey, how much is it?\n",
      "Hey, Dad! We made popcorn!\n",
      "Only in public.\n",

      "It's not fair. Moms want to be fun, but we're stuck with all the... mom stuff.\n",
      "I'm proud of you, Dad. You're the first man to ever outsource the American worker's sense of entitlement and privilege.\n",
      "Oh, for goodness sake. What we need around here is some fresh blood.\n",
      "Oh, Jacques! It fits. You got it in my size and it has my name on it. It's really for me.\n",

      "Wow, this 3-D is amazing! You can actually feel the vase!\n",
      "Smithers. I keep my friends close and my enemies even closer. He'll slowly regain his confidence as the months and years drift by, blissfully unaware that the sword of Damocles is dangling just above his head.\n",

      "Well, how about Grampa? He's pretty out of it. He let those guys use his check book for a whole year.\n",

      "Oops. Sorry.\n",
      "Kids, from now on, I don't want you touching anything in our house. Dart!\n",

I saw you desperately trying to cram one more salty treat into America's already bloated snack-hole. So I did what I could. I did what any loving husband would do: I reached out to some violent mobsters.\n",

      "Dad, have you considered buying commercial time on channel ninety-two? Check it out.\n",
      "Who told you?\n",
      "Oh honey, they have acids that can burn that off.\n",
      "Son, your life is gonna get better -- starting now.\n",

      "Please Dad.\n",

      "Marge, I realized something when I was trapped under all that rubble: marriage is the real roller coaster. I'm just glad I have you as my safety bar.\n",
      "Great. The one time you actually do something right, you ruin my life.\n",
      "Moe! Will you get off the line!\n",
      "At least now I can get some rest.\n",

      "I believe the only venue for me is the ride of broken dreams.\n",
      "Yeah...\n",

      "Well, it wasn't easy, but we managed to watch every testicle fail video on the internet.\n",
      "Hey, what about a prequel to something? Everybody loves prequels.\n",
      "Don't worry, homeboy, you're not that fast.\n",

      "Oh, yeah? What's a palate?\n",
      "Yes, he could fly home, except that he has a broken wing. Perhaps you and your sarcasm could come to Springfield and retrieve him.\n",
      "I've failed again. Everybody can teach a class but me. I'm an idiot. What am I gonna tell my wife and kids?\n",
      "Well, a friendly Springfield hello there, neighbors. I, you know, we think some kids of ours may be missing in your town.\n",
      "And I've got a rally for take back the afternoon.\n",
      "Hi, Ned. I didn't know you were an actor.\n",
      "Sorry, Reverend.\n",
      "I can't believe what I've done -- maybe deep down I always knew how much this film would hurt them. Maybe I'm the monster this movie exposed.\n",
      "Mom! Guess what!\n",
      "All right! This is a story of two dogs with a love so strong, no hose could separate them. I call it Shady and the Vamp...\n",
      "Okay, she moved in with her boyfriend. Well, he's not a boy. He's immature, but fat and old.\n",
      "Awesome. You finally made my room cool!\n",
      "Excuse me... pardon me... whoop... comin' through... how ya doin'?... love that hat, baby...\n",
      "Bye!\n",
      "Again!\n",

      "Hey pal, how ya been?\n",
      "But you said going from blue to gray was empowering.\n",
      "No. It's oddly dehumanizing.\n",
      "D'OH D'OH D'OH D'OH D'OH...\n",
      "Denver?\n",
      "Bart, you're coming home.\n",
      "Please don't air this. I'll tell you the winners of the kickball games in advance -- you can make a lot of cabbage betting on k-ball.\n",
      "Oooh, a punch bowl like that just screams good taste. Wouldn't it be perfect for the dinner party?\n",
      "Uh, maybe we should take a little break-a-rooney, huh? Anyone like a draft beer?\n",
      "Dr. Zander, what happened?\n",
      "And you sat on the gas pedal when my foot fell asleep. So I'm gettin' you shined up nice.\n",
      "What card?\n",
      "No couches either? Oh, man. I need a beer.\n",
      "Ahhh, that's better. Now that we're alone, Papa Bear has a li'l honey for his Mama Bear.\n",
      "That's it! I'll steal this sign and they'll pay me to make them a new one!\n",
      "Hey, they can't take our house. My pot-bellied pig is in there.\n",

      "This map is useless! Useless!\n",
      "So you're sure this baby'll make it out to the desert?\n",
      "Aw, lousy Wiggum. Now the whole town thinks I'm a chili wuss...\n",

      "No, it's true. You know, when I was a boy I really wanted a catcher's mitt. But, my dad wouldn't get it for me. So I held my breath until I passed out and banged my head on the coffee table. The doctor thought I might have brain damage.\n",
      "Yes I do. Because I'm hungry... my clothes are smelly... and I'm tired.\n",

      "Come on, I'll drive you to the airport.\n",
      "Eh, I got standards. I don't hand out high-fives like Chiclets.\n",
      "Does it get you into special exhibits?\n",
      "Well, that was under our old price structure. Under our new price structure, your bill comes to a total of seven hundred dollars. Now, you've already paid me four dollars, so that's just six hundred and ninety-six dollars more that you owe me.\n",

      "Oh no, I crushed that horrible bug. What should I do?\n",
      "Dad, I agree that Bart should be punished, but the Itchy and Scratchy movie is the defining event of our generation. How would you have liked it if someone told you that you couldn't watch the moon landing?\n",

      "Okay, but first the chest.\n",
      "Actually, Dad, as the supervising parent today, you'll get your share of the blame, too.\n",

      "Lou! Lou!\n",
      "That was at my expense. What kind of a roast is this?\n",
      "You don't need that.\n",
      "Probably needs to be more powerful.\n",
      "Sir, today every country has a national anthem. Did they have national anthems two thousand years ago?\n",
      "I just think they're neat.\n",
      "No. I assume it has hay.\n",
      "No.\n",
      "I had a fight with Milhouse.\n",
      "Sounds like a plan!\n",
      "Die, you chalk-faced goons!\n",
      "Marge, I've always loved you. Bart, you were a worthy foe.\n",
      "And then I said to the president... get this Marge? Marge?\n",
      "Ha, ha, ha, you wet your pants.\n",
      "Heel? Oh no, tell me you are not trying to be like Grampa!\n",
      "So, sweetie, am I your hero again?\n",
      "I literally chewed the scenery.\n",
      "I'm outta here.\n",
      "That's it. It's one thing for a ghost to terrorize my children, but quite another for him to play my theremin.\n",
      "Boy, did you make a prank call to Brazil?\n",
      "I used to hate the smell of your sweaty feet. Now it's the smell of victory.\n",
      "We're outta here.\n",
      "I happen to remember it just a little differently.\n",
      "That's why I love elementary school, Edna. The children believe anything you tell them.\n",
      "I'm aware of the time.\n",
      "Let's see. One, two, three... six whiskeys!\n",
      "What's this stuff for?\n",
      "WE GOT AMERICA FEVER / WE GOT AMERICA FEVER!\n",
      "But, there was one thing I wasn't prepared for...\n",
      "Moe's Tavern. Hold on, I'll check. ... Hey everybody! I'm a stupid moron with an ugly face and a big butt, and my butt smells, and I like to kiss my own butt.\n",
      "Bart, I want you to go down to Moe's Tavern. I need you to bring your father home.\n",
      "Sorry, Marge -- I gotta break in my ski boots some time.\n",
      "Here comes my commercial. In six, five, four...\n",
      "Bart! What are you doing in my room?!\n",
      "Networks love reality shows because they don't have to pay writers or actors.\n",
      "Uh, yeah, sure. That thing.\n",
      "No, it's Homer.\n",
      "Y'see? This is the stuff Mom won't do with me.\n",
      "Now boy, everyone in town gets Burns for half an hour to do as they will.\n",
      "This is the most selfish thing you've ever done!\n",
      "I know one person who believes you were the Pie Man, Homie... me. I've known it all along.\n",
      "But my parents are counting on seeing me dance! And I've worked ever so hard.\n",
      "It's not what you think... I came here to warn them... yes, to warn them about, um...\n",
      "Still, it would have been nice to bring home at least one paycheck.\n",
      "Mom, if you're gonna do this, there's one thing I need to know. And be honest. What's your soda refill policy?\n",
      "Congratulations, sweetie. You're in the finals!\n",
      "Okay. Here we go.\n",
      "Oh, I'd love to!\n",
      "Milhouse, quick!\n",
      "Aw, Homer was spendin' money like a teenage Arab. He bought me a Rolex and, ah, cashmere jeans. I felt kinda guilty 'cause I was always trying to score with his wife. So, when do we start filming? Oh.\n",
      "Yup, pretty much. Except we drove around in a van solving mysteries.\n",
      "No! Stay outta there! Stay outta there! Aw, Good God, no!!\n",
      "Can I just...?\n",
      "Wow! Have you ever seen so many robot cowboys?\n",
      "Mr. Fairbanks, lookin' at your boat I gotta say, Gramma bet on the wrong horse.\n",
      "Some special helpers that'll make you a good boy.\n",
      "I believe I know the answer.\n",
      "Wait, there's a commercial!\n",
      "Bleh. This virtual fudge tastes like crap.\n",
      "Thanks. I just washed them.\n",
      "How was your day, sweetheart?\n",
      "Oh no you don't! I just got an idea.\n",
      "Still on the fence.\n",
      "Sideshow Bob!\n",
      "My whole romantic life is flashing before my eyes.\n",
      "Oh. Hee, hee. Sorry.\n",
      "Good Lord, I may lose Edna forever. I've gotta stop her from winning. Then she'll be broken, miserable and mine.\n",
      "You what?\n",
      "What's gotten into you?\n",
      "Good evening, Principal Skinner and welcome to our home.\n",
      "Okay, I'll try the green.\n",
      "Good night, son.\n",
      "Hey, how would you like to show him up by beating him at his own game?\n",
      "No they don't. They--\n",
      "Dad, Bart ate a green bean during the blessing.\n",
      "I concur!\n",
      "That'll do, brick, that'll do.\n",
      "That's because I've loaded it with sugar!!... Marge, our ship has come in! I found five hundred pounds of sugar -- in the forest -- that I'm gonna sell directly to the consumer. And all for a low, low price of one dollar per pound.\n",
      "Put it in the bank.\n",
      "Take that!\n",
      "My strobe light!\n",
      "But I like that statue.\n",
      "No mom, it counts as a hit. Dad just won the game.\n",
      "I'll take ten bucks no-ow.\n",
      "Lisa, if I ever stop loving violence, I want you to shoot me.\n",
      "Well, uh... what do you like?\n",
      "Oh, who am I kidding? The truth is, I'm no missionary. I work in a nuclear power plant.\n",
      "I got a plastic Krusty-saurus.\n",
      "Well how are we supposed to get fuel?\n",
      "Myra, can ya help me out here?\n",
      "Sneh.\n",
      "Gonna what, Homer?\n",
      "Hi yo!\n",
      "Eww. This is the worst place yet.\n",
      "Apaches!\n",
      "Shut up!\n",
      "Deal. My brother...\n",
      "The mother of my children with the reason for my children!\n",
      "Yeah, I promise.\n",
      "Pause the assembly! I have to talk to my wife!\n",
      "How'd it go? Tell me everything that happened! He didn't give you Gay, did he? Did he?\n",
      "So, there I am being nice to Alex, and she takes all of my friends and ditches me.\n",
      "A black hole? I'm sorry, can we call it that?\n",
      "Sorry, Dad. Women and children first.\n",
      "Twist off, dammit!\n",
      "Sorry, Ralph. That would defeat the purpose of testing as a means of student evaluation.\n",
      "Oh wouldn't I? Just listen.\n",
      "Dad, is this another one of those situations that could be solved by a simple apology?\n",
      "Ugh, too eighties.\n",
      "I don't get it, Bart. You got all upset when you killed one bird, but now you've killed tens of thousands and it doesn't bother you at all.\n",
      "I don't know. Maybe they're all reverse vampires, and they have to get home before dark.\n",
      "Wow.\n",
      "Well this is one dilly of a daily, Lisa. Can't wait for tomorrow's!\n",
      "After breakfast me and Milhouse are goin' down to the ravine. We got a tip from a six year old that there's a dead Martian down there.\n",
      "Hello, mother dear.\n",
      "It doesn't take a whiz to see that you're looking out for number one. Well, listen to me and you'll make a big splash very soon.\n",
      "But I...\n",
      "Wha?\n",
      "There's only one can of beer left and it's Bart's.\n",
      "What a magical city! Can we come back next year, Dad?\n",
      "A rescue plane! Get the flare gun!\n",
      "Oh, this is so embarrassing, calling 'em from a nut house. I mean, they think I'm a god.\n",
      "Nonsense, Larry, your blood is bluer than any of theirs! Just give them a snootful of the old Burns charm!\n",
      "Uh-oh. We're starting to attract swingers.\n",
      "Well, I didn't come this far not to cheat.\n",
      "I grow weary of this new channel. Change it back.\n",
      "Ooh! Can I have my special cup?\n",
      "Can we get our big Christmas tree now?\n",
      "Why, Sue Dokes, you rascal! I thought you were dead and--\n",
      "Well, you tell him from me that he makes one great mozzarella stick.\n",
      "Oh for crying out loud -- people aren't mice!\n",
      "What's that you say? You can live without television as long as you have beer?\n",
      "I'll do my best.\n",
      "What?... What am I lookin' at? I don't see nothin'. I'm gonna stop looking soon... What... what, is that it?\n",
      "Homer Simpson at the Super Bowl?\n",
      "No way. Forget it. I might occasionally kill out of anger, or to illustrate a point, but I am not a Grim Reaper.\n",
      "No.\n",
      "I'd have more friends if I knew what people liked. But I won't know what people like unless I'm their friend. It's a conundrum.\n",
      "British version was better.\n",
      "I guess so.\n",
      "Mmm, oh yeah, this baby is done.\n",
      "Uh, not as such.\n",
      "But it won't make you unhappy, right? Hey! Space Food Sticks! Oh, I wish I had these on my space adventure! Did you know I was blasted into space two years ago, Mom?\n",
      "Sorry, Mr. Burns, but I don't go in for these backdoor shenanigans. Sure, I'm flattered... maybe even a little curious, but the answer is no.\n",
      "Wait! Daddy! Wait! Please don't leave. Take me with you!\n",
      "Hot dog! Let's go!\n",
      "Yeah, instead of exhausted zombies running down the clock.\n",
      "I am waiting for a...\n",
      "It's fun for the whole family. And the ends are razor sharp to protect our nation and its interests.\n",
      "Hey Homer, we been runnin' around cheerin' for an hour. Where the hell's the game?\n",
      "You gotta be kiddin'. The lek?\n",
      "Duly noted. But we will make sure not to dilute the sacred gospel.\n",
      "Here!\n",
      "I'm a slow reader!\n",
      "No-sirree-Bob!\n",
      "I see. Well, you know, fellas, I look at the admissions board a lot like a baseball team. You all like baseball, don't you?\n",
      "Way to go, dad!\n",
      "I think Lisa needs another push on her new tire swing.\n",
      "Maybe not so loveable...\n",
      "Homer, don't drink and drive!\n",
      "I changed my mind. It was a passing fancy. Although perhaps if you threw in a few lawn chairs, maybe that tool bench, it might rekindle my interest.\n",
      "Oh, my God! Look what those rotten kids did to my car!\n",
      "You really think my shirts will sell?\n",
      "Do they have to chew so loud?\n",
      "Nah.\n",
      "Why do you still have a thing for Nelson?\n",
      "I bet that bra was planted by Sterling, to break them up.\n",
      "Aw jeez, there's somethin' in my eye. Ah, it's just glass.\n",
      "New arena...\n",
      "We have a fire alarm in the ventilation room!\n",
      "And uh... later tonight I think you and I should uh, snuggle.\n",
      "Bingo.\n",
      "Bart, this could be a good new school... Oakwood Academy! Huh?\n",
      "Thanks.\n",
      "Okay, I'm a liberal. And sometimes that's a dirty word.\n",
      "Dad, that's an ambulance.\n",
      "I'm everywhere.\n",
      "Wow -- the gym ropes are seaweed, the basketball nets are fishing nets...\n",
      "Mr. Bergstrom!\n",
      "We'll see about that.\n",
      "Did you do that?\n",
      "Ooh, a text. Let's see... Text message for I. M. A. Wiener. As you all can see, I. M. A. Wiener!\n",
      "Crawling! Oh, he's really gone. He's gone!\n",
      "Awww, look, Maggie wants to fly too.\n",
      "Because we all know you're a naive pawn, puppet, if you will, of the most diabolical political genius Springfield has ever known -- Birchibald T. Barlow!\n",
      "He took me to a fight that he fixed. But he never let on. Not even when I bet five hundred dollars on the wrong guy. Then he said he would dope a horse for me.\n",
      "Oh, poor Eve. What are you doing out there in that horrible place?\n",
      "Ah... boy, if only Bart had been a better role model for everyone.\n",
      "Homer, what should we do?\n",
      "Sounds like most of the house is still owned by the bank.\n",
      "What do I wear?\n",
      "Eh, you don't want to hear that story. I know! I'll tell you about the time I got locked in the bank vault with Mr. Mooney. It was another one of my hair-brained schemes.\n",
      "Hey! You don't have to pay! Read the sign!\n",
      "The place where the waiters sing.\n",
      "Aren't they jazzy? They match the new curtains we hung in your treehouse!\n",
      "Only seventy-five beans!\n",
      "But does your wife?\n",
      "Dear Bart, I am using the stationery Mom and Dad gave me for my birthday to inform you that we are now brother and sister in name only. Perhaps if a professional so advises, I will give you a hug at some far distant family reunion, but rest assured it will be purely for show.\n",
      "Um, I'm treasurer of the Jazz Club, and started the school's recycling society.\n",
      "Wha... but...\n",
      "Oh, dear.\n",
      "I'm telling you, I'm the Pie Man!\n",
      "Don't you know anything, boy? That's Ringo Starr.\n",
      "Well, you certainly won't be bending me-- Wait, how did I end up in your bedroom?\n",
      "I'VE BEEN WORKING ON THE RAILROAD / ALL THE LIVE LONG DAY... Yeah, that's better.\n",
      "Now get cracking on my long division. And don't forget to show your work, Simpson.\n",
      "Hmm...\n",
      "Ooh, nuts.\n",
      "Lisa, what's bumming you out? They cancel a test or something?\n",
      "Yeah, one time, she-- Oh, she's looking at us. Be cool.\n",
      "Why, those guys are such leeches.\n",
      "Girls, Lisa. Boys kiss girls.\n",
      "A candy corn volcano! A ceiling from Saddam's palace!\n",
      "Secrets and lies...\n",
      "Actually, I quit and I came to get my job back.\n",
      "Life is good.\n",
      "Well, I'm glad everything worked out so well.\n",
      "Yeah, Krusty, tell us.\n",
      "Aye carumba!\n",
      "Let's see...cartilage, cartilage, muscle, nerve!... artery...bullet.\n",
      "Gee, I don't know what you've got planned for tonight, Homer, but count me out. Didn't you buy any meat?\n",
      "Huh? AHHH!! It's my problem! We're doomed!!!\n",
      "Wow, you're right, Dad. It is windy.\n",
      "Where do they get their ideas?\n",
      "Oh my God. Our train! Homie you do care. You care a lot!\n",
      "Gimme that! / Uh, gimme that! / No! / Let go! / Gimme that my washcloth! / I want it!\n",
      "I'm not sharpening it!\n",
      "Oh, it's all my fault.\n",
      "You did the right thing by telling me.\n",
      "Yes, President Franklin.\n",
      "Mom? You're back. Just like you were back before, then you left me again. I love you so much, but it's so hard for me to trust you. Oh, what the heck.\n",
      "I haven't felt this inspired since the blueberries at breakfast!\n",
      "No, he cheated.\n",
      "Well, I don't think it's that unlikely.\n",
      "I really do miss my Homie this time of night.\n",
      "I think I have to do it again. My blindfold came off.\n",
      "Homer, show a little more sensitivity around these jobless washouts, huh?\n",
      "Hmmm, well, thank you. Gee, everyone's so nice here at the Monster Truck Rally. Look, Homer, champagne!\n",
      "Homer, wake up! Wake up! Oh my, here let me wipe off that drool.\n",
      "Look, let's the three of us try it together.\n",
      "That's not the way American police do things!\n",
      "Aw, don't give up, boy. I believe in you -- and not just because I have to.\n",
      "Psst. Psst!\n",
      "Sorry.\n",
      "Jazz. They just make it up as they go along. I could do that. Dee dee dee dee dee dee dee dee dee dee dee dee dee.\n",
      "Sure. We're gonna have a great day. Ba-da-bing ba-da-boom, right Bart? Bart?\n",
      "Forget every word, boy. It's useless.\n",
      "Come on, Marge. Let me carry you over the threshold.\n",
      "Marge! I've wasted half my life.\n",
      "Marge, Marge.\n",
      "What, are you afraid to make a real bet?\n",
      "Okay, kids. Otto's in charge. Remember, Otto, we're trusting you with our greatest natural resource, the school bus.\n",
      "Thanks, Bart. That makes it all worthwhile.\n",
      "Well, Dad and Bart ran away and no one seems to know where they went.\n",
      "Nine months later, I gave birth to Maggie.\n",
      "You!\n",
      "Uh-oh. Somebody's got tired little legs.\n",
      "How dare you?!\n",
      "Now let's go home, son.\n",
      "I'll pay you in Strupo...\n",
      "Behold, Neanderthal man -- our ugliest, stupidest ancestor!\n",
      "What?!\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "All-access.\n",
      "Homie, you got your, your elbow in...\n",
      "Plug it in! Plug it in!\n",
      "I'm hideous.\n",
      "Did you remember to disconnect it first?\n",
      "Hmf. The monkey's on my part of the sofa.\n",
      "Marge, I can't say no to a helpless old lady. They put spells on you!\n",
      "Hey, this isn't such a great prize. Oh, well, this may be a dirty job, but the big guys at the top work even harder.\n",
      "What are you talking about?\n",
      "Stupid kid. All you do is cost me money. Money I could be wasting!\n",
      "'Fraid so.\n",
      "Mr. Gere, I was hoping Buddhism could bring me inner peace. Or is that just a pipe dream?\n",
      "Oh, don't worry. They'll be here soon. And then they'll see who's got the better town.\n",
      "What if I see something really weird in the sky?\n",
      "Well, I say we take 'em out and have our own trial!\n",
      "Will you remember this the next\n",
      "Why on earth would a child go to the zoo...?\n",
      "I don't feel much like eating. I'll never know what would've happened if I'd have been Class President.\n",
      "It's the principle, Smithers! Nobody steals from Montgomery Burns, whether it be my Sunday newspaper or my loutish oaf of a son.\n",
      "We're here to stop you -- with the help of the teenage abstinence class!\n",
      "No, you look a little nervous, Lisa.\n",
      "Fine. I want one gift bag now, and one when the party's over.\n",
      "Hey, I never noticed this place!\n",
      "I've got to squeeze a whole summer of carefree fun into one day.\n",
      "Come on, Lisa! Monkeys!\n",
      "I've never been afraid of a little hard work.\n",
      "Well, come on, you two. Don't forget about the film festival.\n",
      "February twenty-third.\n",
      "Objection, your honor.\n",
      "You don't even know what the idea is.\n",
      "Sure feels weird lying on top of the covers.\n",
      "What are you talking about?\n",
      "Aye carumba!\n",
      "Tomorrow is the biggest day of your lives. The Shelbyville game. So lights out at seven-thirty and abstain from coffee, tea, and cola drinks. Make no mistake, they pack a wallop.\n",
      "Okay, ladies. Don't you have a poodle to dress up?\n",
      "Baby made a boom-boom.\n",
      "Look, stop calling me and start enjoying your vacation. Remember, I want to see lots of pictures when you get back.\n",
      "Homie! Homie, wake up! They've captured your crazed foreign carjacker!\n",
      "It's the natural order of things. I'm afraid she's got another two, maybe three days, tops.\n",
      "Doc, this is all too much. I mean, my son a genius -- how does it happen?\n",
      "But it could use a button. Oh, what if I said... Well if you...\n",
      "Ha ha. You're gonna be Lisa Flanders.\n",
      "I thought it was over. You had a problem turning a blade, you overcame it. The feel-good story of the year.\n",
      "Honey, I'm so glad you're home--\n",
      "Oh, isn't that somewhat unusual?\n",
      "I am?\n",
      "Now, I can't have toothpaste tonight.\n",
      "It was originally published to settle arguments in taverns.\n",
      "And here I was waiting till you slept to rob you of your copper. You know, it's crazy, but...\n",
      "Okay, we'll be right out.\n",
      "I was only reading what the card...\n",
      "Now for the awkward part. We gotta talk about money.\n",
      "Of course. St. Teresa wouldn't be interested in a mere bauble. Her greatest treasure would be a pure young girl. You are pure, aren't you?\n",
      "We did it! We wrote an awesome song!\n",
      "Thank you. Why?\n",
      "Hey, Ray J. Johnson never changed his act and he's more popular now than he's ever been.\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "Anyhow, I must have looked at somebody the wrong way...because the next thing I knew, I was running for my life.\n",
      "Homework? Lisa, you wasted chicken pox. Don't waste the mumps.\n",
      "Wow, this is amazing. I could follow the Ribwich from town to town.\n",
      "Ooo, careful, Homer.\n",
      "Any popped eyeballs?\n",
      "You keep almost dying. Just look at our vacation photos.\n",
      "Our Lord, Buddha, says the secret of existence is to pass beyond fear.\n",
      "They're not evil! They believe in friendship and respecting the earth... and they made me feel like I belonged.\n",
      "Air?\n",
      "You will never work in the fast-food industry again.\n",
      "Dammit! Why do kids have heads?\n",
      "My game! My game! I coulda beat the boy! Marge, how could you? I was so close.\n",
      "You're welcome!\n",
      "All right, I'll talk to Lisa's teacher this year. You can have Bart's.\n",
      "Okay!\n",
      "Wow, Dad. How did you do that?\n",
      "Wake up, boy.\n",
      "Which one? Homer or fat ass?\n",
      "No, I mean American Indians.\n",
      "I'm telling ya, I do work on the Krusty show. Look at the credits.\n",
      "AND THEIR DAMP-TROUSERED PA.\n",
      "Homer... Come home with me.\n",
      "Next!\n",
      "This is what love costs a month?\n",

      "Yes! Homer, we make a dynamite team, huh? With your arm, and my head-gunk, we're goin' right to the top! Whoa.\n",
      "Of course you are. Marge, I've finally discovered the reason God made me: to protect his tiniest, most breakable creatures. And I've got to share that gift with the world.\n",
      "Trust me, I've left a lot out, and cleaned up the swears. Anyway, I ran into some schoolmates and thought they might be friendly. That's what kids do, right? Hang out at the mall together. But when I went over...\n",
      "Oh, I hope we didn't get Apu in too much trouble.\n",
      "Homer! Lisa is receiving the Student of the Millennium Award at school.\n",

      "I knew you were, Dad. I always knew.\n",
      "Actually, Homer got up early to count and sort pills. Then he called the police when a Frisbee landed on our lawn. Then he went to the drugstore for an egg cream, but he only brought a nickel.\n",
      "Please don't go! Please? Please? I command you!\n",
      "It brings me great joy to unite two such loving people. Photo mouse pads for sale out back.\n",

      "Can you get me some of those Flintstones' chewable morphine?\n",
      "Oh, it's not working. Only my sour, curdled breath will quicken him.\n",
      "Oh, she's just jealous. She'll get over it, and if she doesn't, we can always exchange her.\n",
      "They're opening another Mother Hubbard -- across the street?! How could they? How could they?!\n",

      "But now, I want to follow in your footsteps.\n",
      "Oh, so you're better than me, is that it?\n",
      "I was taking them to the groomer's.\n",
      "It's a bone scraping from that skeleton I found.\n",
      "Son, you can dial down the crazy. Your mother and I talked about it and we found a way to get to New York. It's all set, boy. To save money, we're swapping houses.\n",

      "I can't believe Homer left me at the altar.\n",
      "From now on, I'm gonna be just like Krusty and tell it like it is. Marge, you're gettin' a little fat around the old thighs.\n",

      "Hoo!\n",
      "Fine. How's it goin'?\n",
      "Something happens next?\n",

      "I thought we were gonna be pals forever. But, we're gonna have to say goodbye, because you don't understand a single word I say. If you just knew how important it was to learn sit...\n",

      "No!\n",
      "What is this place?\n",
      "Let's just write to David Bowie again.\n",
      "That's it? What happened to all the lobsters, mangoes and chewy chewy cocoa beans?\n",
      "No, I'm gonna ask Marge.\n",
      "No, no. He's fine. Go on, Mojo, show Marge your happy dance.\n",
      "Homer, shouldn't we give that skull to Mr. Smithers?\n",
      "Uh, I'm giving it back to the earth.\n",
      "The Flanders family has pulled up stakes. You have laughed at us for the last-diddily-ast time.\n",

      "Homer Simpson...\n",
      "Oh!\n",
      "I'll bet.\n",

      "It's a hologram?! Well, maybe if it's in good taste...\n",
      "Who?\n",
      "Now while I wasn't able to cut everyone I wanted to, I have cut a lot of you. Wendell is cut. Rudy is cut. Janey, you're gone. Steven, I like your hustle. That's why it was so hard to cut you.\n",
      "Dad! I was telling the story.\n",
      "Is that what we do in this family? When someone becomes an inconvenience, we just get rid of them?!\n",
      "All right, I guess you're supposed to go through this stupid door...\n",
      "I'm Bart Simpson, who the hell are you?\n",

      "Thanks, Magic.\n",
      "Ed Asner?\n",

      "Back off, you servants of the Holy See!\n",
      "When God rested on the seventh day, did He take a nap or do a hobby He enjoyed?\n",
      "Now, Homer, don't worry. All I need to do is find Mr. Burns' inner beauty.\n",
      "Hey, what is this? The Spanish Exposition?\n",
      "I really appreciate you helping me find Homer.\n",
      "Ha, of course I do! Happy anni... birth... entine... shark week?\n",
      "Simpson, eh? How very strange. His job description clearly specifies an illiterate.\n",
      "Wait, people are coming. I think they're Jehovah's Witnesses.\n",

      "Milhouse, it's not that far to the ground. And the rain has probably softened it up a bit.\n",
      "Shhhh! Just watch.\n",
      "Oh, Mom. I've seen what you do around the house, and I can handle it. Maybe I can even make things more efficient.\n",

      "Kindergarten?\n",
      "Why here's the fellow! Wiry... fast... firm proud buttocks. Reminds me of me.\n",

      "Yes'm.\n",
      "Well, I am one: flattered and two: intrigued. Lisa Simpson.\n",

      "Leave the rag.\n",
      "No I don't want any string beans either you two-timing, back-stabbing. Uh oh I better answer. No, thank you.\n",
      "Chewy! That's inspired.\n",
      "Nooooooo...\n",
      "Not if I tell her first.\n",

      "Aw, you're sweet.\n",
      "Hit me.\n",
      "Uh, so. Let's have a conversation. Uh, I think we'll find we have very little in common.\n",
      "He fell for it! Way to go, Marge!\n",
      "Sammy Hagar? You're not dead.\n",
      "We don't need a thinker, we need a doer. Someone who'll act without considering the consequences.\n",
      "Hold on -- I still have to caramelize.\n",
      "Well Homer, looks like I can't go to discipline camp. Which is too bad, 'cause I think this was the thing that would finally straighten me out.\n",
      "Mom's looking good through elementary school... ninth grade, tenth grade, still ridin' the A-Train... Then suddenly, when she was a high school senior BLAM!\n",

      "If she started dinner three minutes earlier, we wouldn't be in this mess!\n",
      "It's hopeless.\n",
      "I've got to fool him before the day is out -- but how? He must have a weakness.\n",

      "That dog can sell anything.\n",
      "Oh, I'm a chicken, am I?\n",

      "Ouch, this place is fancy.\n",
      "Don't blame us, Dad. The celebrities are the ones who canned you.\n",

      "We have to take in Mr. Brockman -- he wouldn't be in this mess if you hadn't dumped coffee on his lap.\n",
      "You're not mild-mannered. You're often liquored-up and rude.\n",
      "So how come we have all these other keys?\n",
      "I said we were having a special guest tonight -- Mr. Tim Conway.\n",
      "What any boy would: push you in a puddle and run away.\n",

      "What did he do in the future?\n",
      "Bart knew the worst thing to do was pile lie upon lie, and that's exactly what he did.\n",

      "Well at least it's a good place to see celebrities.\n",
      "We're throwing the brunch!\n",

      "Could get hurt. Could. There's a chance they won't.\n",
      "Yes they were! But now they won't be! Because I don't have a mini-bike!\n",
      "Bye bye!\n",

      "Whoa! This place has everything! Even a shoplifting department.\n",
      "But I think if we hold off for a while, you'll find I'm well worth the wait. Like a mild cheddar I get tangy when I'm sittin' on the shelf.\n",

      "I didn't take it.\n",
      "Well, it is a good life, believe me... All right, we'll give it a shot. I'll deal with those murderous trolls.\n",

      "Shush! Shut up! Quit trying to push us around. Stop saying those horrible things and show some manners.\n",
      "Justice is not a frivolous thing, Simpson. It has little, if anything, to do with a disobedient whale. Now let's vote.\n",

      "Oh that's sweet. Guess what. There's a new place at the mall - they'll put your picture on a T-shirt. I got two dollars off because mine got smeared.\n",
      "Don't worry, kids. Your father'll be okay, as long as he's with those Sherpas.\n",
      "That's okay. I got 'em.\n",
      "What? No! With my last ounce of strength I sucked out my gold fillings and swallowed them. Those paramedics have sticky fingers.\n",
      "Hm. I brought you a tuna sandwich. They say it's brain food. I guess because there's so much dolphin in it, and you know how smart they are.\n",
      "Look everybody! My purse exploded!\n",
      "Mom! Bart's flicking boogers on me!\n",
      "We never had a problem with a family member we can give away before.\n",
      "Everyone loves you, Dad. You could become a famous rock star!\n",
      "All right, you, gimme back my phone, and nobody gets hurt.\n",
      "Oh. Well then, carry on.\n",

      "Man, how'd I live without this thing?\n",
      "Is this her?\n",
      "Oh sure... Remember when I got caught stealing all those watches from Sears?\n",
      "What do we do?\n",
      "Now Bart, you keep an eye out for the mailman. Just give me some kind of signal.\n",
      "Oh, yes we are!\n",
      "And?\n",
      "Outta my way, you God-fearing Buckleheads!\n",
      "Now what is this all about?\n",
      "You'll do as I say or I'll have your badges. Once I make and give you your badges.\n",
      "Wow, never had breakfast at six in the morning before.\n",
      "No, cash.\n",
      "Sixteen.\n",
      "Larry Flynt is right! You guys stink!\n",
      "Marge, we can't do that! All the kids'll call him Larry Fairy.\n",
      "Bart's growing up without me. He won't be ten forever.\n",
      "So Simpson, I hear you like pizza pie.\n",
      "Run!\n",
      "Sushi? Hey, maybe this is just one of those things you hear on the playground... but, isn't that raw fish?\n",
      "You?\n",
      "We can't have a space creature living in our house.\n",
      "That my family isn't the center of my universe? Are you nuts?\n",

      "Aw crap. I fold.\n",
      "Guys, keep it down. I got some last words. I never told you this before, but sometimes when I'm at work, I think of you and smile. So often I think that ... oh, words won't do it. I love you, Moe.\n",
      "Out of our way, corn! The starving people of Springfield are desperately in need of our delivery of canned corn, corn flakes, and flash frozen corn nibblets.\n",
      "What say we take our worthy adversary out for a hot fudge fun-day?\n",
      "It's a bottle cap.\n",
      "Here you go.\n",
      "Simpson, all you have to do is babysit the Princess -- keeping her in this hotel room during the negotiations.\n",
      "All I see is two million people happier than me.\n",
      "Hey Dad, have fun with your boyfriend.\n",
      "Dad, you're just going through a classic oedipal anxiety. You remember the story of Oedipus, don't you?\n",
      "Mr. Scrooge!\n",
      "What the? Who turned off the wind?\n",
      "How did you know?\n",
      "I picked my Malibu Stacy hybrid convertible. It runs on her old makeup and out-of-style shoes.\n",

      "Well, it has four digits...\n",
      "S'open!\n",

      "Okay, now to see if I can apply my book knowledge to the real world.\n",
      "Aren't you proud of your big sister, Mr. Pinchy? Hmm? Hmm?\n",
      "Deal!\n",
      "Did you get that the pony was actually me?\n",
      "Fifteen-ninety-six...\n",
      "Oh, no!\n",
      "No, Maggie! Come here, girl. Come to me.\n",
      "What?! What is it?!\n",
      "Crazy classroom, bus full of missing kids... I know who'd have some answers. Someone who's been here a long, long time.\n",
      "That's cats.\n",
      "You just have to stay there until that psychopathic school inspector makes a surprise visit. You can come home when the heat's off.\n",
      "Docetism?\n",
      "Can I hollow out this one's head and use it as a turtle tank?\n",
      "P.U. When is this over?\n",
      "Kids, kids, you're both right.\n",
      "Better call Dr. Hibbert.\n",
      "Yes, dear. All you want.\n",
      "Well, you don't have to be sarcastic.\n",
      "Heh, Rex Banner. What a dope.\n",
      "Deal!\n",
      "The lad has a point.\n",
      "Homie? Aren't you going to come in?\n",
      "Oh good Lord.\n",
      "Go back? But I didn't show you the place where Dave Grohl got mugged.\n",
      "Yes, Bart's weird friend.\n",
      "Where? Where?!\n",
      "Maybe when we find something decent to do with this I.D.\n",
      "Dad, what's that on your lap?!\n",
      "Hyah!\n",
      "Good luck, Dad.\n",
      "Five days! But I'm mad now!\n",
      "I can dig it!\n",
      "That's it! Whew, I'm glad one of us remembered. That could have been embarrassing.\n",
      "Just do it. Do it. Do it now!\n",
      "Yeah, right. Son... I'm gonna teach you a lesson. I'm going to stand here and watch you smoke every one of those cigarettes. Then maybe you'll learn...\n",
      "I don't like the looks of this.\n",
      "Oop, I guess I'll just go and watch some cartoons.\n",
      "I just wish there was some way to get back at my Dad.\n",
      "Have you found a picture yet?\n",
      "Okay, okay, okay, I'm in!\n",
      "Excuse me, is this an orphanage?\n",
      "I miss him too.\n",
      "ALL AROUND THE SOMETHING WORLD,\n",
      "Hey book, are you expecting this?\n",
      "Tell her I'm at a meeting, not drinking...\n",
      "Whatever you want.\n",
      "Sorry, Homer, I'm afraid it's separate accommodations for you notly-weds.\n",
      "Maybe he's going through... certain changes.\n",
      "They revamped this ride because of massive complaints from two people.\n",
      "Do you see towels? If you see towels, you're probably in the linen closet again.\n",
      "I'll never trust another old person.\n",
      "How someone someone abuse their body that way?\n",
      "Oh yes, Lisa, very seriously. Whee.\n",

      "A LeatherBuddy! There's no limit to what I can do with this.\n",
      "Wow, It looks like an alien headquarters. Couldn't you just see aliens runnin' out of there? Couldn't ya? Hey, wait up.\n",
      "Your father is... resting.\n",
      "What are you gonna do, tell Mom and Dad? They're powerless figureheads.\n",
      "Why are you here?\n",
      "Gee, business stinks tonight. Where's Barney, Lenny, and Carl?\n",
      "Mom, you can't send him away! He's a dog, not Grampa!\n",
      "That's Carl.\n",
      "I think we should leave.\n",
      "Homer, stop that!\n",
      "Uh-oh.\n",
      "Stupid kids ruin everything.\n",
      "Or you!\n",
      "Wait! What about Maggie's memories? Surely the innocent soul of a child will redeem mankind.\n",
      "Wow, tear gas, riot club, police hat...\n",
      "I won't be happy until I find out what you're up to. Wherever you go and whatever you do, I'll be there watching and waiting.\n",
      "Let us outta here!\n",
      "I've had it with that school!\n",
      "C'mon, Dad. Let's go.\n",
      "Aren't those supposed to be confidential?\n",
      "Do you ever hide beer around the house?\n",
      "No way.\n",
      "Homer, I have to go out to pick up something for dinner.\n",
      "Hm. I guess considering all the training you've received, this is quite reasonable. I've never seen anything so reasonable! It's the bargain of a lifetime! And--\n",
      "It's so fancy -- sushi bars, a sixty-screen movie theater, museum of tolerance...\n",
      "Dad, maybe you should do this.\n",
      "I don't like your tone.\n",
      "Oh, I love legitimate theater.\n",
      "I'll teach you to...\n",
      "Yeah. Hop in, Homer.\n",
      "Exactly. Heh, heh.\n",
      "Uh, that's what we call the gay guy who lives with us.\n",
      "There's the real Milhouse.\n",
      "My love. You saved my life.\n",
      "I've realized how much I missed you -- and I can see from this magnificent Lisa statue that you felt the same way.\n",
      "Sorry, Homer. You'll have to call me a Ray-theist, 'cause I don't believe I saw him.\n",
      "Be cool or you're grounded!\n",
      "Batting nine. Unky, Herbbbb!\n",
      "What about jags?\n",
      "It's in Drugtown. Not the nice part.\n",
      "How long has he been there?\n",
      "Is it your impression of Mr. Burns eating soup? Because I'm not in the mood.\n",
      "Exam?!? Oh, this is just like one of those bad dreams.\n",
      "Just appreciating how lucky I am to be with you.\n",
      "Then that makes me the Jackie Robinson of the sport. And you are the racist Philadelphia manager!\n",
      "It's only the milkman. Hey, maybe I should be a milkman.\n",
      "Yeah, tell you the truth, I'm not even sure.\n",
      "Swab? I thought it was a spray.\n",
      "Huh?\n",
      "Dad, no!\n",
      "This car's so clean! I'm not getting flea bites on my ankles!\n",
      "Bart!\n",
      "Aw, jeez. There's always a line.\n",
      "It's been so many years since I've seen your father. I hope he's still the magnificent physical specimen he was when he left.\n",
      "Lisa can't be a magician -- that's my thing! I'm the one that got a magic set for Christmas two years ago.\n",
      "Wow! This is the biggest Rice Krispy square I've ever seen. Boy, the rich sure know how to live.\n",
      "Hey, just 'cause I'm not working doesn't mean I can't gripe like you guys. Don't you hate it when people steal your lunch out of the break-room fridge?\n",
      "Thank God. I couldn't take another minute in this hell-hole.\n",
      "Oh, man. Plain cake donuts? Thanks for taking all the fancies, guys. Why can't I ever get here on time?\n",
      "Simpson...Lisa.\n",
      "Here's your birthday breakfast!\n",
      "Singing opera made me good at painting.\n",
      "Aka ni taishte burei da! Yogore o yaburu!\n",
      "All right. Hey, hey!\n",
      "Wow, that's Moe! The guy from the ad!\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "To texting!\n",
      "How did you know?\n",
      "...So Lisa asked if her new friend could stay for dinner! She's finally doing something the book said she would!\n",
      "What's for dinner, ma?\n",
      "Wait a minute... If you're here, then you've fallen asleep too!\n",
      "It's like you're the Jesus of carpentry.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Well, my show and tell is that I'm on Lisa's body--\n",
      "I think you'll find escape is quite impossible.\n",
      "I wonder where all the kids are.\n",
      "Lisa's costume. Homer, I didn't realize. I'm so sorry.\n",

      "Hey Lisa -- Racing from Belmont? Horsies!\n",
      "Cool! I call the Flintstone Phone!\n",
      "I don't got it.\n",
      "No, I'm very upset.\n",
      "But I'm so sweet and tasty. Well, time to go to work.\n",

      "What do you recommend?\n",
      "That's a prison road crew.\n",
      "Simpson, I am by most measures a successful man. I have wealth and power beyond the dreams of you and your clock-punching ilk. And yet, I've led a solitary life. The fair sex remains a mystery to me. You seem to have a way with women, a certain... how shall I put it? Animal magnetisme. Help me, Simpson. Tell me your secret.\n",
      "Hey, you're wrecking it!\n",
      "Okay, bad example. So let me ask you this, does your money ever hug you when you come home at night?\n",
      "I don't know.\n",
      "...'cause I got a lotta spyin' to do.\n",
      "No! No! I meant you were one of the good-looking ducks... that makes fun of the ugly one.\n",

      "Don't you think I've got better things to do on my honeymoon than spy on you two?\n",
      "What? I'm a monster, right? I knew it. I guess I'll just crawl back to live in the sewer, periodically emerging to sue you.\n",
      "This romance is so full of heartfelt passion. I can really identify with this corn-fed heroine. Homer. Are you awake? This is important, give me some sign you're awake.\n",

      "All right. It's time to vote for the grand prize.\n",
      "No way are you gonna to beat me this time, Lis!\n",
      "And that's that. Another story in the classic, infallible three-act structure. Good enough for Aristotle, good enough for the Simpsons.\n",

      "Milhouse, there's someone who wants to see you.\n",
      "Oh, man. Why does everything bad have to happen to me?\n",
      "Not your fault, man. Those parasailing guys take whatever they want.\n",
      "How do you cope with it?\n",
      "Urchins!\n",
      "I can't wait to tell everyone!\n",
      "But it comes from a true place...\n",
      "Well, I don't miss his nonsense. There's a lot of stuff he blamed on raccoons that I'm starting to suspect was him.\n",

      "Oh, are you? Well, you go ahead and call your precious dog warden, you old battle-ax, because my dog is tied up in the backyard.\n",
      "Okay, here's how it goes. I'm the leader. Milhouse is my loyal sidekick. Nelson is the tough guy, Martin's the smart guy and Todd's the quiet religious guy who ends up goin' crazy. And now, the time has come to cross this line into mystery and danger. To step out of childhood and become men.\n",
      "Ah man, he's makin' us look like a bunch of cheapskates. Whoa whoa. My rope came loose.\n",
      "This is from the National Fatherhood Institute. It evaluates your knowledge of your son and rates you as a father.\n",
      "Oh, if I buy this, I won't have anything left for a Christmas tree...\n",

      "Mom, can you bring me more O.J.?\n",
      "Thanks, honey, for saving me from myself.\n",
      "Well... what have we here? Looks like your un-cool dad scored tickets to Hullabalooza.\n",
      "That sounds like fun. I'll just tell Homer and--\n",
      "Here's your skates. Oh, you'll have to take off those boots.\n",

      "All hail Emperor Clobbersaurus!\n",
      "It just is. That's why.\n",
      "Eduardo. I haven't felt this good in years. You're like the Tooth Fairy except you don't collect human bones.\n",
      "Oh, sorry.\n",
      "Gosh. This is all happening so fast. I don't know what to say.\n",
      "Good one.\n",
      "No, no, no, no, no, no, no! Please don't do anything. Not only have his grades gone up, but the enthusiasm has gone out of his pranks.\n",
      "Great! Now we're raccoons -- the masked bandits of the animal world!\n",
      "Get back here, boy!\n",
      "Is it really okay to just drop them into the pit where the Blockbuster used to be?\n",
      "Homer, you don't do things like that to be rewarded. You do them because a fellow human being needs a helping hand.\n",
      "Come on! Pick up the pace!\n",
      "You're absolutely right, Homer. We don't need a baby-sitter.\n",
      "My name's Lisa Simpson. I think your protest was incredibly brave.\n",
      "Listen you two, I'll tell you who the true God is if you're both quiet the rest of the trip!\n",
      "I will! Edamame?\n",
      "No.\n",
      "Oh, right. Separated.\n",
      "Lis, that place is great! They have a jukebox in the basement! And look at the trick they taught me!\n",
      "Oh, yeah.\n",
      "I could see a planetarium show without the secondhand marijuana!\n",

      "Hurry up, Moe, for the love of God! Hurry up!\n",
      "Well, I might as well use this pucker for something.\n",
      "Homer, please, don't tempt the gods. I-I mean God! There's-there's one God! Only one! Well, sometimes there's three.\n",

      "Kids, marriage is like a car. Along the way it has its bumps and dings, and this country can't make one that lasts more than five years. With Lurleen I just walked past the showroom and didn't even go inside. Now let's return to watching the news.\n",
      "All right. You got us into this, you get us out.\n",
      "So long stomach. We've had a lot of great memories.\n",
      "Good morning, everybody! What's for breakfast, cutie?\n",
      "You're not ice cream... faker!\n",

      "You guys need a break. Why don't I take Bart with me to the children's be-bop brunch at Jazzy Goodtime's?\n",
      "Look at the cool stuff that washed up!\n",
      "That guy's hilarious. I especially like his white shirt and blue pants. Wait a second... Angry Dad is me!\n",
      "Show me the law that says I can't! Wheee!\n",
      "No, honey. You just passed out when you saw the private bedroom in our triple upgrade!\n",
      "Y'ello.\n",
      "It's not funny! You're wearing cleats!\n",
      "Those two hairs were what was left of my youth, Moe.\n",
      "Oh. It's Bart. I can't believe it. I'm being mocked... by my own children... on my birthday!\n",
      "No surrender!\n",
      "Your plan makes no sense.\n",
      "You just don't say no to the Redheaded Stranger. And when I heard it was for awareness, that sealed the deal.\n",
      "Hidilly-hey, Homer!\n",
      "Um, well...\n",
      "Tell me all you know about the gem.\n",
      "Yeah!\n",
      "Well, I knew that before I came in here. A guy outside told me that.\n",

      "Marge, would you go to the prom with me?\n",
      "...but, well, I guess he did miss three days of school --\n",
      "Hey, Milhouse. How's the lemonade business?\n",
      "So, now you're smarter than your old man, eh?\n",
      "For your information, since I bought it I put on a ton of weight.\n",
      "Nothing! I can't believe Vincent Price would lend his name to such a shoddy product.\n",
      "And Cinderella's stepmom made her sew clothes and mop the floor.\n",
      "Woo hoo!\n",
      "Carpool!\n",
      "Bart! On't-day ell-tay om-may uffi-ray as-hay e-say e-days.\n",
      "I could've done a lot worse, Mother.\n",
      "Hey! I said that. My name is Lisa Simpson, and I made a chart of all the suspects in the Burns case. Look.\n",
      "Who said you did?\n",
      "Jebediah Obediah Zachariah Jedediah Springfield came West in 1838.\n",

      "What the hell was that? I probably shouldn't have eaten that packet of powdered gravy I found in the parking lot.\n",
      "And the food will all be weird foams -- cooked with chemicals, or served in a test tube. It's too crazy for you.\n",
      "Marge, I'm back!\n",
      "Yeah, but I gotta warn you that this thing is ee ... Yeah, that's what it is. Wanna try it? Heh, heh, heh.\n",

      "I've been having snuggle dreams!\n",
      "Ah, finally a little quiet time, to read some of my old favorites.\n",
      "I got an idea: you can march to Selma -- and tell her she's ugly!\n",
      "So you don't want to kill me anymore?\n",
      "Thanks. So here's my digs.\n",
      "It wasn't easy, but I got all the grizzlies.\n",
      "Mr. Simpson, I don't even know you -- I'm not making love with you!\n",
      "Oh, all right, but not a minute later -- 'cause once the sun goes down, all the weirdos turn crazy.\n",
      "Me, too.\n",
      "So, Dad, what kind of stupid idea did you put in Lisa's head?\n",
      "This interview is over!\n",

      "You little shutterbug.\n",
      "Just a minute, Van Houten. Somebody needs to guard this place tonight so it doesn't get trashed. How'd you like to be night watchman?\n",
      "Isabel! I want this campaign to be about the issues: same-sex fieldtrip buddies, providing class pets with a path to citizenship...\n",
      "Who else has a story?\n",

      "We do that every night! Come on! Jump on the bed!\n",
      "I'm reviewing the festival for our school paper.\n",
      "Sayonara, sucker!\n",
      "No. We're phasing out the games. People drink less when they're havin' fun.\n",
      "Oh, you know how that embarrasses me.\n",
      "I will.\n",
      "Mmm, load-bearing wall.\n",

      "Listen -- can you teach me to fight like you do?\n",
      "Sweetie, you don't understand. If I can do this myself, then all those lies I told will be true. Don't you want Daddy's lies to be true?\n",

      "Can I weld that?\n",
      "Yes, we've isolated the problem and wouldn't you know? False alarm. It seems a single wayward crow flew into our warning system.\n",
      "Aw, look. I've made some friends. And now, go do my bidding... whatever it may be!\n",
      "I said I'm a human, not a girl.\n",
      "Was I there?\n",
      "Hey, we'll worry about that after you're elected.\n",
      "Yeah. You know, looking at this sweet precious child makes me want to have one of our own.\n",
      "Look here, Inspector. Could I speak to you privately I-in my office?\n",
      "All I need is my trusty sling and one good hard...\n",
      "Uh huh. And how much does it cost?\n",
      "Bye, Laddie.\n",
      "Why don't you wear a tie that goes with my eyes?\n",
      "Go on. Please.\n",
      "I was out getting drunk, then killing people!\n",
      "Simpson!\n",
      "SKINNER! / YOU SURE LOOK GOOD IN CHAPS... SKINNER...\n",
      "What're you, the narrator?\n",
      "The Pennyloafer!\n",
      "Yes, sir.\n",
      "Willie, stop!\n",
      "I want you to punch me in the eye. If you do, then we're even, according to Exodus, Leviticus and Matthew.\n",
      "This is the darkest day in the history of Springfield. If anybody wants me, I'll be in the shower.\n",
      "Sweetheart, there's nothing I wouldn't do for that magazine.\n",
      "Yeah, the decent thing to do is bury him at sea.\n",
      "Good, take this note over to the referee.\n",
      "First, I want you to hurl a ball at the nearest authority figure.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Hey, you're right! What I enjoyed was spending time with my husband.\n",
      "Can you be my dad?\n",
      "You know, Marge you're right. The Simpson family is the best possible club I could belong to.\n",
      "I got ya.\n",
      "Were you the ugly one?\n",
      "What's the point? They'll never notice.\n",
      "Oh, so much money...\n",
      "Go! Save yourselves!\n",
      "You're gonna get a bath tonight.\n",
      "That didn't answer anything. I need more information.\n",
      "Up-up-up. When I'm done.\n",
      "Hey, it's me, Bart. Your biggest fan?\n",
      "Now to return to a future where I'm either rich or allowed to stand in front of a rich guy's house. Either way, better than now.\n",
      "Oooo.\n",
      "Tutoring? The only thing Bart's teaching is guerilla combat in Shelbyville.\n",
      "Hello, pretty boy. That's quite a beak on you.\n",
      "Lisa, honey, if you really want to preserve his memory, I recommend getting a tattoo. It preserves the things you love.\n",
      "Well, guess! Book of Revelations... Fire-breathing lion's head... tail made out of snakes... Who else is it gonna be?!\n",
      "Sure is sunny... Was the air always this fresh?... I'm just gonna hang out in this vent.\n",
      "Behold, the tailgate party -- the pinnacle of human achievement!\n",
      "I don't mind being called a liar when I'm lying, or about to lie, or just finished lying. But not when I'm telling the truth.\n",
      "Hm.\n",
      "You mean those leagues where parents push their kids into vicious competition to compensate for their own failed dreams of glory?\n",
      "It's gone...\n",
      "What's that got to do with it?\n",
      "Here's a role model for you, boy: Rin Tin Tin. He was brave on and off the screen. He was the first openly gay dog in Hollywood.\n",
      "We need to take this into the belly of the beast. Mr. Scalper, give me a ticket.\n",
      "You bet I do.\n",
      "Hey everybody! How you doin'? Look at me! I'm Homer Simpson! Heh...heh.\n",
      "They'll be back. We control the world's supply of tomacco and no one can take that away from...\n",
      "You love your son. How can you be so hard on him?\n",
      "Yes! I'm missing one son! Return it immediately!\n",
      "You can't break us up. We're like a family here.\n",
      "No! I don't agree!\n",
      "Don't pull! Don't pull! I said don't pull! Don't!\n",
      "Yeah, look at 'em crowding the bar! There's Sully, and Mack, Jimmy D. and Jimmy B.! What can I get ya, boys -- the usual?\n",
      "Loveless loners are so lucky. There's no way I can afford to give Marge a nice anniversary present.\n",
      "Cold. So cold.\n",
      "See?\n",
      "Get to the show!\n",
      "Good-bye, Bart!\n",
      "Was that... uh, was that toilet always next to the refrigerator?\n",
      "How can anyone relax when they made us park in stack parking?\n",
      "What did you do this time, you little hoodlum? Oop. Get out of the way.\n",
      "He said what now?\n",
      "Maggie, look what's in your ear, a penny.\n",
      "Huh?\n",
      "Not cinnamon.\n",
      "You really put on a great reception, Marge. It's like the happy flashback in a gritty cop thriller.\n",
      "What did I say? What's going on?\n",
      "Look, if you tell what I did, I'll get in trouble.\n",
      "Aiyeeee!\n",
      "You're gonna regret this.\n",
      "I'm just saying, why not have two geniuses in the family? Sort of a spare in case Bart's brain blows up.\n",
      "Mmm... memo.\n",
      "I call the red one!\n",
      "I know he doesn't look like him, but I'll never forget that voice!\n",
      "I'm Lisa, I'm eight years old, and this might sound presumptuous, but -- I'm your favorite.\n",
      "I am proud to honor the players of the Negro Leagues of Rollerball. And as we strive for the desegregation of all deathsports, we cannot help but be inspired by...\n",
      "Maybe you killed them all.\n",
      "We're not losers. Last year we finished six and five.\n",
      "You know, boy, some of the players you see tonight may make it to the big leagues, one day.\n",
      "How do you like my new wheels, Simpson?\n",
      "Hey Flanders, Don't spill my beer!\n",
      "Missed one, Dad.\n",
      "Could you?\n",
      "I'll never pay off that debt.\n",
      "No. Marge, if I lose my job in this economy, it's a death sentence. Oh, I guess, as a fallback, I could direct films like Angelina Jolie. How many properties do we have an option on?\n",
      "Marge, do you want this last pork chop?\n",
      "The place that changed my life?\n",
      "Hey everybody, Mom's home.\n",
      "Come on kids, fun comes from inside -- it isn't about what we actually do.\n",
      "Three-peat.\n",
      "Hey! Where are you goin'? I'm your pal! I took you for a walk once!\n",
      "Krusty?\n",
      "I don't care what that stupid test says, Bart. You're a dimwit.\n",
      "Why you! I'm gonna chop you into pieces and make you into a Rubik's cube, which I will never solve!\n",
      "Can I interest you in a mincemeat pie? There very...\n",
      "It's Easter! Why aren't these people at work?!\n",
      "And no TV!\n",
      "Duck, Mr. Lincoln!\n",
      "Nice doin' business with you, boy.\n",
      "How 'bout this?\n",
      "Wow, Marge -- once again, your Mom-ly wisdom averted disaster.\n",
      "Hmm, I don't know.\n",
      "Oh, this sucks. I want to see Vice-President Cletus.\n",
      "You'll never guess how many bath towels they gave us... enough!\n",
      "You should have seen the look on your face. It was something like this.\n",
      "Oh Homer, save me, save me!\n",
      "Homie, she's not making a snuggle film.\n",
      "Deal. See, Flanders, you give a little, you get a little.\n",
      "Oh, aw, man, how are we supposed to kill the rest of the afternoon?\n",
      "Well, you won't be laughing when you see how many pickpockets this thing catches.\n",
      "Can I turn my phone on?\n",
      "I just wanna sit down, but the line for the bench is too long.\n",
      "How 'bout some sauce?\n",
      "You're a very selfish man.\n",
      "I know what you mean. Our dog had that.\n",
      "He is. And may I save that paper?\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "You're gonna be so embarrassed. There are two other people at this party dressed just like you.\n",
      "Make with the tea, Jeeves.\n",
      "Nothing like un-tossing a leftover salad. It'll be like new!\n",
      "Okay, little buddy, hop in!\n",
      "Are we there yet? I'm thirsty.\n",
      "... Flintstones' chewable morphine.\n",
      "What?\n",
      "It's Bart.\n",
      "Please, just leave me alone!\n",
      "I'm not sure that is water.\n",
      "Let me finish my sentence!\n",
      "Don't worry, Mom. They all passed by.\n",
      "Three steps right...\n",
      "And when I couldn't talk, I learned to listen.\n",
      "Oooo.\n",
      "Well, I'm convinced. The house stays!\n",
      "Now wait a minute...\n",
      "They said if I come in late again, I'm fired. I can't take that chance.\n",
      "He is alive. He's wagging his tail.\n",
      "My daughter's at that Egyptian dealy right now. She wanted to take a limo, but I made her take the bus.\n",
      "Homer, I don't want guns in my house! Don't you remember when Maggie shot Mr. Burns?\n",
      "Ah, Larry, my lad, I've gone over this story in my mind a million times. It was 1941 -- the -- no, '39 -- my 25th Yale reunion...\n",
      "I should have known I wasn't old enough to take the bus alone, but I really wanted to see that exhibit. I'll never take another stupid risk like that again!\n",
      "Ooh, this is one of our trips to Barnacle Bay! We used to rent a beach house there every summer.\n",
      "I don't want to hear your whining. I'm a bored and joyless old man, give me a laugh!\n",
      "I hope Dylan likes trucks.\n",
      "The system works!\n",
      "Laugh at the clowns' buffoonery!\n",
      "Just set it to voice mail.\n",
      "They're gay, I get it.\n",
      "So you're good at noticing dress colors, but not the eyes that make your dinner!\n",
      "Oh well, this is our stop.\n",
      "Marge, I did it out of love. Love of not being arrested. But I realize now that nothing is more important than you.\n",
      "Hey, everyone, I'm back! Great to see ya! Nice seein' ya!\n",
      "You're pretty uptight for a naked chick. You know what would loosen you up? A little fruit.\n",
      "Oh, come now. Everyone has his price.\n",
      "Eeenie meenie minee moe, catch a tiger by the toe... If he hollers let him go, eenie meenie minee moe.\n",
      "Why are you torturing me? I'm just a man.\n",
      "Oh baby...\n",
      "Sleep tight. The Container Store now has five convenient locations!\n",
      "And that man sold it to me!\n",
      "Who are you?\n",
      "Kids, there's something I have to tell you -- your mother and I are wetting the bed.\n",
      "Sure we can't talk you into it?\n",
      "Excuse me. How can you put up an exhibit on the origin of man and not have one mention of the Bible?\n",
      "Oh, yes.\n",
      "Oh my God. You've taught me a valuable lesson!\n",
      "Oh no. I'll be socially unpopular. More so.\n",
      "Y'know, I was skeptical, but I guess therapy works.\n",
      "Bart!\n",
      "Business, what business?\n",
      "Well, tonight is a very special night. Your father is taking me out for dinner and dancing.\n",
      "No, don't tell me, I'll get it... Oh, I know! The Lord is vengeful! O Spiteful One! Show me who to smite, and they shall be smoten!\n",
      "Whoa! Homer, it's like there's a party in my mouth and everyone's invited.\n",
      "Bluella?\n",
      "Ignore, ignore!\n",
      "So I looked in the window and there it was, the grossest sight I have ever...\n",
      "Whuh?\n",
      "S'allright?\n",
      "No. We can't start thinking that way about our own family members. Suspicion could tear us apart.\n",
      "Whoa, whoa, whoa...\n",
      "Pardon my French, but sometimes that man's a goofy-doofy.\n",
      "Uh, that's a parasol.\n",
      "Why does Jesus have a lasso?\n",
      "Oh honey, that's just silly! This'll show Helen Lovejoy, always bragging about her He-She cousin!\n",
      "Oh my God, I've never felt so... uncreeped-out by you!\n",
      "Oh my, it's five o'clock! I missed visiting hours.\n",
      "Did you two ever get back together?\n",
      "Hello!\n",
      "Mo-om! Dad's imagining me as food again!\n",
      "Hey, you're the one always bugging me to screw up our marriage.\n",
      "If you kissed her that would be lovely.\n",
      "Aww, a gift from my favorite crustacean.\n",
      "Look, I did marry her, but I abandoned her. Amber, tell her how I abandoned you.\n",
      "As you can see, this old place is falling apart. But I'm sure we can come to an understanding.\n",
      "Wait, I have a better idea. You'll work for me now.\n",
      "He's going to die!\n",
      "Oh, Homie! You make each eight-year interval better than the last!\n",
      "Pay the man, boy.\n",
      "Artie Ziff? Ohh, oh, that e-mail. Look, I got a little drunk and we...\n",
      "I have the situation under control. The compass needle is pointing east.\n",
      "Sleep is for the weak, Apu! Now I'm gonna go to bed while you look over my notes from ninth grade history.\n",
      "Will you bring me back something?\n",
      "My RV is gone! It was more than a motor home. It was a car I could go to the bathroom in. Hey, a note.\n",
      "Shhhh! Just watch.\n",
      "Milk. That's for babies and old guys who can't sleep at night because of what they did in the war. Broccoli.\n",
      "Chair goes round... chair goes round.\n",
      "Me too, Moe. What a nice surprise that we've become friends.\n",
      "Ah, I tell ya the way these checks keep coming in, it's almost criminal.\n",
      "Milhouse!\n",
      "Shaft.\n",
      "Now, folks, nothin' spells fun like rhinestones on a dungaree jacket!\n",
      "Is Seymour there? Last name, Butts.\n",
      "Moe has a cappuccino machine??!!\n",
      "The steering wheel is a giant onion ring!\n",
      "My yard sale is a failure. I guess I'll have to give everything to the Salvation Army.\n",
      "You cost me a piece of all of that!\n",
      "Oh, well, he may be a horrible freak, but he's still my son. I'm sure we'll grow to accept him in time.\n",
      "Look!\n",
      "Calm down, Dad. What happened?\n",
      "Ah... oh, that isn't smoke. It's steam. Steam from the steamed clams we're having. Mmmm, steamed clams.\n",
      "Y'ello.\n",
      "You faked it?! Lisa, how could you?!\n",
      "For the last time, no!\n",
      "All right, show yourselves in the name of this book!\n",
      "Oh, I don't want to bother the internet with my problem.\n",
      "Eh, they'll be chewin' on him for a while.\n",
      "I know, the window!\n",
      "Hmm... me, the patriarch of a bird-racing dynasty...\n",
      "Wow, Lenny. Your apartment is stunning.\n",
      "Where? Where?\n",
      "All right!\n",
      "But Marge, we're not mass married.\n",
      "Why do we have to audition for this stupid play and Dad gets to leave?\n",
      "I got the idea from a show where people regret these.\n",
      "Maggie's genius and creativity far exceeded that of the others. And I'm not just saying that 'cause I'm her mother.\n",
      "I think a hurricane is coming!\n",
      "Smithers, this calls for the League of Evil!\n",
      "Possibly!\n",
      "Let's go, kids. I can't watch any more.\n",
      "I denounce thee for giving people ambitions they cannot fulfill! And I denounce thee for positing a world where social acceptance and walking on heels are easy!\n",
      "Reverend, why do we really need this?\n",
      "See if Lenny wants to go in on a spoon.\n",
      "Didja hear that, Mom? She's as dumb as me!\n",
      "No.\n",
      "Who loves ya, baby?\n",
      "What? Name me one person who's gotten rich by doing yo-yo tricks.\n",
      "Done.\n",
      "Honey, if you get too competitive you'll never be happy. No matter how good you are there's always gonna be someone better than you. I always thought I had the tallest hair. But that trip to Graceland really opened my eyes.\n",
      "Where's all my stuff?!\n",
      "Could you cut it out, you two? Mommy needs some quiet right now.\n",
      "Now, on to the next funny booth.\n",
      "Lisa, if you ever want to quit and come home, I'll be here in half a jiff.\n",
      "Yeah, that must be it.\n",
      "Man, that bird did it all. Good guy.\n",
      "Okay, what's an appropriate movie for you boys?\n",
      "Ah-ha! Made you rise.\n",
      "Barney!\n",
      "I don't care about these church jerks... church jerks... church jerks...\n",
      "Sweetheart, come to dinner.\n",
      "Hm, sounds like a plan.\n",
      "Wow...\n",
      "I can do this... I can do this...\n",
      "Marge, it takes two to lie. One to lie and one to listen.\n",
      "Thanks. I'll see you in heaven.\n",
      "Wait a minute, Marge. I saw Mrs. Doubtfire. This is a man in drag!\n",
      "Ew. How 'bout I'll just look at you.\n",
      "So you're saying I should do your job, for you, at home, for free. You wish.\n",
      "N-Not yet. But one of the mall security guards took a good long look at a left-handed ice cream scoop.\n",
      "Bart, I got a cassette from Mom and Dad! I thought we could listen to it together.\n",
      "Why... that's my husband!\n",
      "Just let 'em ring.\n",
      "No. They moved to Phoenix.\n",
      "What a mall!\n",
      "Noooo!\n",
      "I sold my soul to Milhouse.\n",
      "Well, I'm uh, I'm afraid Edna has gone from tardy to absent. So uh, let's uh move onto the reception and forget this awkwardness with some delicious shrimp mocktail.\n",
      "He's here.\n",
      "Of course.\n",
      "No! I only learned that four days ago.\n",
      "Ha! I can see them now with their bald heads and their blue-haired wives. How I despise them.\n",
      "Cut me some slack, I'm a widow.\n",
      "My God, you're greasy.\n",
      "Okilly-dokilly, let's put on our game faces.\n",
      "What if I undo this button?\n",
      "Of course! Of course! I would never, ever have thought of that!\n",
      "Well, I'll be. The Itchy and Scratchy Movie.\n",
      "Young man, brace yourself...\n",
      "We're a family again!\n",
      "Aww, you're just saying that.\n",
      "You know, this is wearing a bit thin.\n",
      "Hello, I, uh, love your planet deeply and am interested in purchasing one of your electronic autos.\n",
      "Have you ever seen a Kung Fu movie? It was just like that. But now I know her moves. So, if you're listening to me, lady, you better think long and hard before trying something like this on Homer Simpson again.\n",
      "Bah! Computers! They'll never replace my Huffnagle autocollator!\n",
      "I guess. You're funny! No wonder Lisa's in love with you.\n",
      "Show you what it's like in the real world!\n",
      "Except what?\n",
      "Hello, my animal friends. Peace be with you.\n",
      "But how's tomorrow for you?\n",
      "You did?\n",
      "Look at this: Springfield Elementary's rating is so low, it's more than two standard deviations below the norm.\n",
      "It is?\n",
      "I do! I do!\n",
      "Everybody in the kitchen! We're having a family meeting!\n",
      "No.\n",
      "Moe, quick! Beer me before I answer the phone!\n",
      "I wanna go home now.\n",
      "Yeah, but still...\n",
      "Dear Homer, I.O.U. one emergency donut. Signed, Homer. Bastard. He's always one step ahead. Oh, I'd sell my soul for a donut!\n",
      "Dad! We've been robbed!\n",
      "I don't know... we have church the next morning... starts at eleven...\n",
      "Overfed? I don't know this word.\n",
      "I said I'll take it.\n",
      "NEIN AUCH IM WINTER, WENN ES SCHNEIT...\n",
      "So when Dean Peterson opens his door, this bucket of Super Glue is gonna drop right on his head...\n",
      "Oh, come on! That millionaire playboy? He's too busy socializing at cocktail parties and managing the affairs of the Wayne foundation.\n",
      "Okay. I'll just stay calm and approach this scientifically.\n",
      "Okay, okay.\n",
      "So, according to creationism, there were no cavemen.\n",
      "Marge likes sushi, I like gum that squirts in your mouth. She's into romantic comedies, I like movies where there's only one day a year when murder is legal. Yep, Marge and I see the world in totally different ways.\n",
      "Oh my.\n",
      "Who said that?\n",
      "It's not fair. I always wanted to drive a food-shaped car.\n",
      "Oh, that sounds fabulous, Homer. Stores throw the best parties.\n",
      "Oh, that poor little boy. We've got to find him.\n",
      "Hurry, Moe. At three o'clock they're going to put us in the exercise yard. The exercise yard!\n",
      "We can't let Lisa get her hopes up.\n",
      "Well, if you want to keep this job, you'll make it your style.\n",
      "Do you see why I brought you here, Simpson?\n",
      "Oscars? What are you talking about? My son gave me this list of awesome things to do in L.A.\n",
      "But, but you don't understand...\n",
      "Well duh!\n",
      "That sucker soaks up flattery like a Twinkie soaks up gravy.\n",
      "Congratulations, Artie.\n",
      "How should I know?\n",
      "Wrong answer.\n",
      "Dad, what's wrong?\n",
      "What's wrong?\n",
      "No, I didn't. I even came in early and made orange drink.\n",
      "Get down, get down, get down!\n",
      "Yeah, you look great! You can do anything with that sewing machine.\n",

      "I think that guy's a spy.\n",

      "Well... I really should discuss this with my wife.\n",
      "Well sorry, the shelter's kinda full.\n",
      "Forget it. That line didn't work for my dad and it's not gonna work for you.\n",
      "I didn't get one yet.\n",
      "Bart, get out!\n",
      "Perhaps he realized how hollow the pursuit of money is, and took his own life.\n",
      "You gotta hide me. Death is after me! And I don't entirely trust these cowboys.\n",
      "Cool, the NFL's oldest surviving player.\n",
      "What do I do?\n",
      "We are more than just a garage band desperate to do anything other than hang out with our families. We are now a cover band. And we shall be called... Covercraft. Because we play covers and this is our craft.\n",
      "If you don't stop smiling, you're gonna get a kiss!\n",
      "Because he knows that if Mom and Dad don't get married, I'll never be born!\n",
      "Tonight, we've all come to honor a close friend of ours...\n",
      "Hope that farmhouse has a phone.\n",
      "Marge! Are you running off with Moe?!\n",
      "Your perfectly-trimmed mustache...\n",
      "Well, a blockaded bishop is of little value, but I think you're referring to a pawn.\n",
      "I don't know. I feel like a kid in a candy store.\n",
      "I'll poke a broom in there! You know I'm capable of it!\n",
      "But you don't understand, Marge. I have fifty bucks riding on this game.\n",
      "All right, all right. D.M.Y.\n",
      "I don't want people to know my kids go to this lousy school.\n",
      "Man, are you illin'.\n",
      "Oh no, I ripped it.\n",
      "Uh, I learned the touch of death.\n",
      "But it's a single bed.\n",
      "A stamp museum?\n",
      "Got any junk that will go up in value after you die?\n",
      "Five figures!\n",
      "Business, eh? Well let me tell you something. You just lost yourself a customer!\n",
      "Oh, I can explain that. You see...\n",
      "I was afraid you'd cancel our date so I stayed away from you completely, even though it meant skipping school for three weeks and graduating this summer... I hope.\n",
      "But you don't need a stupid telescope. It's right there.\n",
      "You changed your grade with a computer?\n",
      "Dat's right. Kiss the troll and win a prize.\n",
      "There's our Broadway Baby!\n",
      "Oh. Well, I seek it so I can find my sister. How do you know about the gem?\n",
      "Yes, Lisa Junior?\n",
      "Gimme the bat, Marge. Gimme the bat! Gimme the bat! C'mon, gimme the bat. Gimme the bat ba-bat!\n",

      "Anyhoo, we came out of Walmart, when suddenly one hundred spaceships...\n",
      "I've read that people do strange things in their sleep when they've taken Ambien -- I mean Nappien.\n",
      "You'll be back. And so will you... and you... And you!\n",
      "Heh. Heh. Stupid animals.\n",
      "Huh?\n",
      "This time, he's the lesser of two evils.\n",
      "Won't this overload the motor?\n",
      "Hey, what's going on?! Wait, wait! Hey, let go of me!...\n",
      "If I still love you, Dallas. If I don't, Buffalo.\n",
      "I'll be anything and everything you want! Don't leave me here with them!\n",
      "Why don't people like me, Marge?\n",
      "You really think so?\n",
      "Yoink.\n",
      "Crisscross.\n",
      "Simple villagers, I promise you I will close plants in America and bring work here.\n",
      "So, how long before you shipped Grampa off to the old folks home?\n",
      "Honey, you really shouldn't eat so much in bed.\n",
      "Fine! I'll stay a little more.\n",
      "Why must you fight with every utility?\n",
      "I think what my father's saying is you're like a member of the family now.\n",
      "Wow, Dad, you took a baptismal for me. How do you feel?\n",
      "This is horrible.\n",
      "Do we have a deal?\n",
      "Whee! Whee!\n",
      "He ran all the way here.\n",
      "Are you pushing?\n",
      "What's going on out here? Homer! Bart! Lisa! Maggie! Stop it!\n",
      "Mama! Mama!\n",
      "Absolutely. Insurance is the greatest deal ever. If I get hurt, I get paid. And man, do I get hurt.\n",
      "Mickey Mouse's dog?\n",
      "Why'd they leave England?\n",
      "You tell her, Big H! / You da man! / Eh, you ain't so hot.\n",
      "You did. His name was Stampy. You loved him.\n",
      "No, no. You're Augustus Gloop, the fat German boy!\n",
      "Can't you yell at me now and get it over with?\n",
      "I'll have you know I'm lop-shouldered.\n",
      "Well, I did finish first in the Walk For The Cure... of homosexuality.\n",
      "Ooh la la.\n",
      "Goodbye.\n",
      "Aaagh. Him again.\n",
      "Oh Homie!\n",
      "You do? Ha ha, ha ha ha!\n",
      "Give me the old stars and stripes.\n",
      "Two points. Your turn, dear.\n",

      "Yeah. Another day, another box of stolen pens.\n",
      "I never knew Jim Belushi made so many movies.\n",
      "Well guess what, I am not a brunette! I'm a blonde!\n",
      "And me smell like drugstore cologne the rest of the day? I don't think so. You may hug... my shadow.\n",
      "Homer, maybe Mr. Burns will bowl a great game and you will win your championship.\n",
      "He TOSSES a paper and yells out the window.\n",

      "So, uh, you guys are my new coworkers.\n",
      "Okay, you can go out and play, but... no more you know what in front of the house, all right?\n",
      "Yeah, the luck lasts longer! Thanks to the power of returns, this store is our closet!\n",
      "Dad! Dad, a little help?\n",
      "This is just what I was hoping for. Spending the day together as a family.\n",
      "Yeah, why aren't we doing Lenny's story? That thing's hilarious.\n",
      "Hey, I'm starting to think I can win.\n",
      "Yes, it's the latest craze. Try some, won't you?\n",

      "Oh, imagine that -- sleeping quietly after a bug attack! Oh, and Todd's as dry as a bone! Lisa, you're a wonder! I'm going to recommend you to everybody!\n",
      "I can't believe how young we looked... in my memory.\n",
      "Well I can't. You'll just have to learn to live with your mental problem.\n",
      "Hmm, I guess Bart's not to blame. He's lucky too, because it's spankin' season and I've got a hankerin' for some spankerin'.\n",
      "Now, Lisa's going through this phase where she doesn't eat any meat. So I usually sneak a little meat juice into her vegetables.\n",

      "Someone thinks we're leaving. I'll wave them off.\n",
      "None of those girls has had three kids, I can tell you that.\n",
      "Now to turn on the moto-mimic.\n",
      "Bart, just tell us the problem!\n",
      "Homie, the waiter's still here.\n",
      "Hah, why even unpack?\n",
      "I just wanted to impress you.\n",
      "It's your foot doctor, Gil! Yes... yes... oh dear... I can't tell him that.\n",
      "Hmmmm... Milhouse, change of plan -- observe and follow.\n",
      "Excellent.\n",
      "Didn't you read Mom's book?\n",
      "They took away our donuts at work! All I've had are my meals!\n",
      "I'm telling!\n",
      "It's mom!\n",
      "We're not here for rabbit. I used to live in this house as a girl.\n",
      "Aww, they were just about to show some close-ups of the rod.\n",
      "Yuh huh.\n",
      "Oh, no you don't. No. No. Get away from me. Uh-uh.\n",
      "Yes. And I can tell how hard it was to lose your father. But at least you were there to share his final thoughts.\n",
      "It's not that kind!\n",
      "All right, Bart that's it! Go to your room NOW!\n",
      "If I told you I'd have to kill you. Can I tell ya?\n",
      "Wait... maybe Bart has a kryptonite!\n",
      "C'mon, I'm trying to impress a girl.\n",
      "Yes, Krusty?\n",
      "Oooo.\n",
      "Wait, dad. Don't do it. I won't jump anymore, I promise.\n",
      "Oh, no. It's a package from Ralph.\n",
      "Wait... do you even have a family?\n",
      "Too late. The deed is done.\n",
      "Kill myself? Killing myself is the last thing I'd ever do. Now I have a purpose, a reason to live. I don't care who I have to face. I don't care who I have to fight. I will not rest until this street gets a stop sign.\n",
      "Bo-ring.\n",
      "And staplers. Computers and staplers.\n",
      "I was talking to him. You, what day is this?\n",
      "Homie, you're back!\n",
      "A phony bird call?! That means Marge is coming! Everyone, act legal!\n",
      "I never realized before, but some Itchy and Scratchy cartoons send the message that violence against animals is funny.\n",
      "I'm surprised he doesn't try to blame his problems on his Percodan addiction.\n",
      "Woo-hoo! Come to papa! Marge, I'll be out in the car.\n",
      "Shh! This bully friend of yours... Is he a little on the chunky side?\n",
      "Ah, snowmen have peepers. Peepers to watch. To watch for our moment of weakness and then baff! comes the knock on the head and we're down.\n",
      "Woo hoo!\n",
      "What a fun-filled evening.\n",
      "The first rule of bus safety is always wear your seat belt.\n",
      "So he's stuck like this forever?\n",
      "He's gonna make a tuxedo out of our puppies!!!\n",
      "Milhouse! Just what is going on?\n",
      "So, do you think you might see your way clear to moving back in with your maw and me?\n",
      "That's my boy. Everything on Santa's Little Helper.\n",
      "Hey, look what I found!\n",
      "Nope.\n",
      "Oedipus killed his father and married his mother.\n",
      "Stop that! We're guests in Mr. Burns!\n",
      "Months?\n",
      "The holiday season is approaching and these children need a school...\n",
      "Ow! Quit it.\n",
      "While I deal with this, why don't you start on that basket?\n",
      "Dad! You're not supposed to have fun recycling. This is serious.\n",
      "Wow, she looks like a background character in a Hanna Barbera cartoon!\n",

      "Kids, come back in the house!\n",
      "Mmm! Tasty! Love the texture. What is it?\n",
      "What are you doing?\n",
      "Who could it be? A disgruntled former employee? Whoever it is, the cobra is their symbol.\n",
      "Oh hey Homer, I hope you didn't forget that today's our big day!\n",
      "I never want you in this house again!\n",
      "What?!\n",

      "First we reel them in, then we scare the hell out of them.\n",
      "Melvis? Where's Mary?\n",
      "Oh no.\n",
      "Well, we didn't get any money, but Mr. Burns got what he wanted. Marge, I'm confused. Is this a happy ending or a sad ending?\n",
      "It's true. You have good coping skills.\n",
      "Stop kissing that cat and get in the car!\n",
      "Not today.\n",

      "Hear that, Maude? Homer's a critic.\n",
      "What about gym?\n",
      "Go on...\n",
      "... Flintstones' chewable morphine.\n",
      "All yours, Homer.\n",
      "So, that's why I'm cleanin' things and flushin' things, and makin' this place look respectable.\n",
      "He's working on a jigsaw puzzle.\n",
      "It's not over yet!\n",
      "Well, I quit my job just like you said to.\n",
      "Bart, did you hear that?\n",
      "What exactly is it your company does again?\n",
      "Cu-ckoo!\n",
      "How about you, Barney?\n",
      "Wait, I know he's an unethical magician, and his tattoos are a inconsistent mix of hieroglyphics and cuneiforms. But he doesn't deserve to die.\n",
      "Absolutely. Our third Sunday of every month should be a pleasure, not a chore. Where's some place fun we can take Grampa next time?\n",
      "You don't have to join a freak show just because the opportunity came along.\n",
      "Marge! Marge!\n",
      "Perfect.\n",
      "Yes, sir.\n",
      "Oh, Homie! You're alive!\n",
      "Coltrane? Lisa, I'm glad you're ready to love again. But a kitty needs a proper name, like Whiskers. Or Paws Scaggs.\n",
      "Give me the drugs, Lisa.\n",
      "I don't talk like that.\n",
      "Okay, we'll go to my second choice.\n",
      "Only a true father would lead his son to believe he belonged to someone else.\n",
      "That's okay sweetheart. Your pig thingy didn't mean it. It's just... it felt comforting to know that while we watched TV, there was art going on behind us.\n",
      "Lisa, there's absolutely no evidence this is...\n",
      "Boy, you weren't kidding. Your profit margins are razor-thin.\n",
      "Woo hoo!\n",
      "Well, because before my wretched life comes to a close, I want to know that I had one friend. Also, because while you slept, I violated you repeatedly.\n",
      "Y'ello.\n",
      "That's lucky.\n",

      "Now you have a friend.\n",
      "I'm sorry, I don't really want to be here.\n",

      "Homer, would you at least let me take you out on a date?\n",
      "Get out.\n",
      "Homer, that suit doesn't leave much to the imagination.\n",

      "I'm doomed!\n",
      "A fresh face!\n",
      "Oh yeah. That's the thing the guys at the drycleaners get so excited about every four years.\n",
      "Ah, the first pour of the day. Let me just tie on my apron, limber up the ol' tap-pullin' arm...\n",
      "And this is for pushing me off the cliff.\n",
      "Hmm, perhaps. Tell you what. We come back and everyone's slaughtered, I owe you a coke.\n",
      "To Daddy, the real world gets fainter and fainter every day.\n",
      "And now I want you to meet your new brother, Hans Moleman.\n",
      "My spine is not a scratching post!\n",
      "Fine. Then...\n",
      "A role model in my very own home. How convenient.\n",
      "Isn't that skirt a little north of the knee.\n",
      "Ho-mer.\n",
      "But you got to kill...\n",
      "I mean it, boy.\n",
      "The outlet store.\n",
      "Look, I don't have time for childish games. If I don't do my job, atoms go boom!\n",
      "You're selling what now?\n",
      "No.\n",
      "You don't seem very jolly.\n",
      "Stop the wedding!\n",
      "Hey, somebody sign an autograph. Please, somebody!? Sign an autograph. Hey, would you sign... You fat, stupid jerks!\n",
      "'Course, we'll have to cut back on our own homework.\n",
      "Perfect.\n",
      "No.\n",
      "WHA...?!\n",
      "Homer!\n",
      "I use up all-a my English.\n",
      "Bart, you are the meanest, nastiest little boy that ever lived.\n",
      "Lenny said you were babysitting. And if you are babysitting, why can't you do some at home? I could use a night out.\n",
      "She hit the bottle pretty hard and lost her job.\n",
      "I'm needed at the door!\n",
      "Joe DiMaggio?\n",
      "I'll tell you where we're not going: jail.\n",
      "This is the last time you'll see that... elevator baby!\n",
      "What does that mean?\n",
      "Dad, why don't you throw me in the air, and I can see which way is out.\n",
      "What about him?\n",
      "Bartholomew, you don't need him. I can be your schoolyard chum!\n",
      "You're not really talking to me. You're just my overactive imagination.\n",
      "Well, we'd better do it quick. Because he's making scones!\n",
      "He doesn't care, Mom.\n",
      "You actually did it! You're the coolest, Dad!\n",
      "Hm. So, should I bring a towel?\n",
      "This isn't bad.\n",
      "Does anyone remember when it was considered rude to talk in church?\n",
      "Fine. Put my name first.\n",
      "What in God's name are you talking about?\n",
      "Not perfect?! You can say that again.\n",
      "Well, then you think of something!\n",
      "Oh. My. God. He's telling the truth. I have to take you to our civic leaders.\n",
      "Oh, my eyes are burning!\n",
      "Overstay my welcome for forty years?\n",
      "Oh, oh... thank God!\n",
      "Watch me dive! Watch me dive! Watch me dive!\n",
      "Yi-yo-yu!\n",
      "Woo hoo! Vegas here I come!\n",
      "Oh ho, I'm afraid I played a dirty part in this little charade.\n",
      "Well, well, well... If it isn't Professor Know-it-all. 'Scuse me, Marge.\n",
      "Yes. Funny that.\n",
      "Hell.\n",
      "What do ya think, Lisa?\n",
      "Then get married. What the hell do you want from me?!\n",
      "Krusty, you gotta help us.\n",
      "Well, Homer's gone. Let's all go into our suspended state till he gets back.\n",
      "Good old Carl's phone went straight to voicemail. Again.\n",
      "And twenty per cent off everything? Hey, does that include rat spray?\n",
      "Oh for crying out loud...\n",
      "Homie!\n",
      "Oh Marge, thank God you're back! She made me spend time with the kids. And not just TV time. Talking time!\n",
      "Please, Homie, I know you can do this.\n",
      "How was detention today, dear?\n",
      "Oh, dang it!\n",
      "Well, it is good to see you, Chloe. Would you like to come over for dinner tomorrow?\n",
      "Oh, I see what's goin' on. You can't stand to be around a guy who's got total financial independence.\n",
      "I don't think so.\n",
      "Chill out, Mom. They gave me this hat.\n",
      "All done.\n",
      "Outside? That's where me and Milhouse played.\n",
      "I hear there's a Korean barbeque place where the beef spells out the date of your death.\n",
      "No, not until you earn it. Until then, I will never see you as my equal.\n",
      "Ah, my gym shorts.\n",
      "I'm definitely getting this one. Oh, but I forgot about this one! Oh my God I never even saw this one!\n",
      "Oh, right. With the giant heads.\n",
      "Even the joeys?\n",
      "You haven't seen your dad in years.\n",
      "He was granting favors to all of his bestest buddies.\n",
      "Sorry, but I was planning to stop by the Olympic Pin Center to fill in a few small gaps in my collection. Y'know, just to get me through the day.\n",
      "He'll be somewhat missed.\n",
      "Homer, you sing all the time!\n",
      "Way to go, Ralph!\n",
      "Hi, Mom.\n",
      "Dad?\n",
      "What did I do?\n",
      "Oh Lord, protect this rocket house and all who dwell within the rocket house.\n",
      "Dad, have you looked at this earnings report?\n",
      "Homer, don't look.\n",
      "All right, how's this for a wager? A batch of your wife's delicious blueberry muffins against one of my wife's homemade wind chimes!\n",
      "Quick, Edna! I'll use your purse as a scoop.\n",
      "No!\n",
      "What kind of hair?\n",
      "Enfeebled?! Oo, I know just the guy! Be right back.\n",
      "I hate the Golden Age of Sail.\n",
      "Well, that's all over now. From now on, we will focus solely on important issues.\n",
      "Yeah, I've got a lot of fond memories.\n",
      "Sorry sis, I've moved on, and my days of listening to my manager are over.\n",
      "Sounds interesting.\n",
      "I see--\n",
      "You left a trail of lost winter clothes.\n",
      "Are you sure? He's having a growth spurt.\n",
      "Son, we are about to break the surly bonds of gravity and punch the face of God.\n",
      "Will there be beer?\n",
      "Englishwomen don't pump gas naked!\n",
      "Homer?\n",
      "Yeah, yeah, yeah, well, I wish I could help you but we're looking for my brother today. Can you tell me his name?\n",
      "Lisa, do you think you could check on your father?\n",
      "I sawed you on the television.\n",
      "I told them it was a benefit. They think they're saving the rainforest.\n",
      "Oh, shut up, you tub of guts.\n",
      "I coulda sworn I just heard someone shriek my name.\n",
      "Carl spent all our money on this stupid page from a stupid saga.\n",
      "Well, children, any questions for Postmaster Bill?\n",
      "Mmm, good pancakes, Mom.\n",
      "Hmm, let me think... take my family to a war zone... on a bus filled with religious lame-os... in a country with no pork... in a desert with no casinos... ooh, where do I sign up?\n",
      "Lisa, you're learning many lessons tonight and one of them is to always give your mother the benefit of the doubt.\n",
      "Play with Lisa.\n",
      "So Grampa, not like I'm anxious to go, but I've been here ten minutes, which is like seven hours in kid years...\n",
      "They have malls on land?\n",
      "I submit! I submit!\n",
      "Ooh, you love a man!\n",
      "Sorry, I only eat food in bar form. When you concentrate food, you unleash its awesome power, I'm told. That's why I'm compressing five pounds of spaghetti into one handy mouth-sized bar.\n",
      "There's Orion... the Swan...the chariot race...\n",
      "Nothing.\n",
      "Oh, God.\n",
      "Bring it in!\n",
      "Okay, everybody. Let's see some big smiles.\n",
      "I don't recall.\n",
      "Then forget it!\n",
      "Faster! More dangerous!\n",
      "Awesome fake-out!\n",
      "But I'm talkin' about Shaft.\n",
      "Well, well, well. If it isn't little Jimmy Pearson. Class of '71 I believe.\n",
      "Woo-hoo!\n",
      "Mom, you can't fight that guy.\n",
      "Hey, Banner, how's it hangin'?\n",
      "Hello, sir. Uh... Mr. Herman, did you lose your arm in the war?\n",
      "Whee! I'm in me! / Oh! / I love the down parts! Here comes!\n",
      "Steady, steady...\n",
      "Wow, all these people are gonna see Dad's show.\n",
      "Huh? Oh.\n",
      "It never spins the other way. In the Northern hemisphere, water always drains counter-clockwise. It's called the Coriolis effect.\n",
      "I guess everyone has a different vision for the perfect world.\n",
      "Obnoxious fad?\n",
      "Ah Barn, you gotta unwrap the plastic before you smoke these.\n",
      "Now what do we do?\n",
      "No, this is... Bo's Cavern.\n",
      "Mr. Burns. Would you like to come in?\n",
      "I see the light! It burns!\n",
      "You missed a spot.\n",
      "Homer, you look just like a little boy.\n",
      "Books and cocoa in the same store? What's next? A talking banana?\n",
      "I know you are...\n",
      "Downtown.\n",
      "All day long they tell me stupid, pointless, boring stories, and I have to stand there listening with a phony grin plastered on my face.\n",
      "Now remember, Juliet's family is very classy, so be on your best behavior.\n",
      "Look Dad, it's the drummer from Bread!\n",
      "A.m. kindergarten made the Bart doll. P.m. kindergarten made the Lisa. The point is, we're not allowed to have you in this building.\n",
      "Oh, thanks, man. Whoa, look at the size of this thing. I wonder if it really works.\n",
      "Last night, someone ate all the food in the fridge.\n",
      "Get outta here!\n",
      "Thank goodness this crisis was averted. Nicely done, Lisa.\n",
      "Well, isn't this nice?\n",
      "All right, from now on, no talkin'. If you want to signal me, use this bird call:\n",
      "I'll be Lisui... the devil-may-care rocket pilot.\n",
      "I suppose I do take Maude for granted.\n",
      "Yeah, that's right. Me, Mr. Party Pants. So, uh... so don't hold it against Homer, eh?\n",
      "Yeah, sure thing, Lenny.\n",
      "I'm afraid the best thing I could find is this.\n",
      "Get bent.\n",
      "You, off the bench.\n",
      "But the note was asking you to --\n",
      "Die don't.\n",
      "Now kids, in lieu of one of those inflatable jumping things, please welcome Mr. Krusty the Clown!\n",
      "The whole town is laughing at me behind my back. I guess you're the only real friend I have.\n",
      "I still don't know why you had that photo enlarged.\n",
      "Bart! How do you know these things?\n",
      "How did it go?\n",
      "I-I love what you've done with these poles.\n",
      "Hey, swabby. You've missed spots there... and another one there... and there... Every other spot is begrimed!\n",
      "You just don't get it. I've made a sacred commitment to the Catholic church, and... paintball! Awesome!\n",
      "Hello? Calling from England? Certainly I can put you on speakerphone.\n",
      "That's you!\n",
      "What? Why?!\n",
      "The prison snitch is killed! And that could be you! Because you're the prison snitch!\n",
      "Do the line. Just do the line. What's gonna happen to me?\n",
      "You're a little light here, Dad.\n",
      "Stop naming things!\n",
      "Isn't it weird that our parents are giving marital advice? They're always fighting -- if you listen closely, you can hear them arguing right now.\n",
      "Hey Dad, whatcha doing?\n",
      "I think it's Mom's turn, son.\n",
      "Don't leave now! The next piece is an atonal medley by Philip Glass!\n",
      "Ooh, sweet.\n",
      "All right, Moses, lead your people.\n",
      "Maude? Rod? Todd?\n",

      "Well, I'm sorry, I just had my glass of warm milk which means I am closed for business!\n",
      "But could Bart have gotten those eggs?\n",
      "Rural route 9? That's it! We can hide out at the farm where I grew up!\n",
      "He sexually harassed me.\n",
      "Aw, he's trying to eat ewectwicity.\n",
      "Hey, Grampa. Stealing Mom's car?\n",
      "That doesn't sound like bees.\n",
      "Look, Dad. I don't know what's going on, but once you gave me some advice that might help.\n",
      "Homer, you can't just keep hanging out with these Colobus monkeys. Somebody's gonna get parasites.\n",
      "Hmm... this quaint artist community has gotten a little touristy.\n",
      "But church can be fun.\n",
      "Catch me, Flanders!\n",
      "Then with your last ounce of strength you pointed to W and S.\n",
      "I'll say, Dad. You must really love us to sink so low.\n",
      "Pretty good, huh?\n",
      "Well, if I may dust off an old chestnut, aye carumba. Aye carumba indeed.\n",
      "I don't think you should. Let Lisa be alone with her new friends.\n",
      "And Lord, thank you for letting me see this wonderful place where the end of the world will soon begin. And thank you, again, for the challenge of Homer Simpson... we've all got our crosses to bear. Me Homer, you the cross. And now, let me gaze with reverence upon the holy resting place of...\n",
      "Who wants rations?\n",
      "GRIM--\n",
      "Yeah, and entertainers are always winning elections. Jesse the Body Ventura, Sonny Bono, Gopher from Love Boat, Mary Bono...\n",
      "Dad, don't you see you're abusing your power like all vigilantes? I mean, if you're the police, who will police the police?\n",
      "Wipe the blood off the windshield and get in the car, boy!\n",
      "We're wetting the bed?\n",
      "Marge, it's three a.m. and I worked all day!\n",
      "Might as well face it, I'll never find anyone. Come on tide -- take me with ya. I just don't wanna feel no more pain.\n",
      "Twister!\n",
      "Lisa, I want to buy your rock.\n",
      "And maybe you'll stop overeating too!\n",
      "Well, it's not just kids using SpringFace -- it's moms like me. Marge!\n",
      "Is there any room in that bed for a dad-burn fool?\n",
      "Aaahhh!\n",
      "I'm gonna be the best car thief ever.\n",
      "I had no idea, Dad. I just assumed with all the stranglings, you know...\n",
      "Mojo, will you wipe my mouth?\n",
      "Really, anyone? What about the Hulk riding a rhinoceros? Would you stop him from laughing?\n",
      "Get outta here.\n",
      "Come on, everyone's helping.\n",
      "Did you steal dolls from my daughter?\n",
      "He's tough but fair. I'll start sorting these bras.\n",
      "C'mon, Marge. We're a team! It's uter-us, not uter-you.\n",
      "Shake it! Now, roll over on your tummy, just like I taught you.\n",
      "No it hasn't, Dad. That's why we're leaving.\n",
      "... that's right, Homer Simpson.\n",
      "Kids, can I talk to Wayne alone a minute?\n",
      "Homer, we gotta do something! Today he's drinking people's blood, tomorrow he could be smoking!\n",
      "I don't know what the big deal is. I mean, it never bothered any of you that my father's French. You know, Bouvier?\n",
      "What does sequestered mean?\n",
      "stupid...\n",
      "Yeah, right. A baby shot a guy.\n",
      "Oh, how precious. The cat's sittin' in my dinner.\n",
      "Thanks for buying us these toys, Grampa.\n",
      "Sweetheart, maybe you just want Krusty to be alive so badly, you think you see him everywhere. I went through the same thing when Lyndon Johnson died.\n",
      "Oh great, now Hamlet's acting crazy. Well, nobody out-crazies Ophelia! Hey, nonny, nonny, with a hoo and a haw and a nonny, nonny, hey...\n",
      "No Bart. Knowledge.\n",
      "Mr. Burns, you brought us a present.\n",
      "Well you did. And they got laughs. Solid laughs.\n",
      "Oh yeah, oh sure, it's easy to point out my faults. It's a little harder to shut up.\n",
      "My back! There goes my back again!\n",
      "So when's Grampa getting here to babysit?\n",
      "I can't get a straight answer out of this crazy hemisphere!\n",
      "No fair, Lisa didn't get sick.\n",
      "I can't believe it passed.\n",
      "Let's see how this plays out.\n",
      "Hmm, I guess so.\n",
      "Oh, great... All right, what makes you say that?\n",
      "Thanks guys, I um... huh, this collar's feelin' pretty tight.\n",
      "Woo hoo!\n",
      "Oh, you mean Tennessee?\n",
      "Well... how are you?\n",
      "Shhh!\n",
      "How did I get here?\n",
      "Homer, I think we should go. We're not like these people.\n",
      "Okay, the museum's got to be north of here. Now which way is north...?\n",
      "Why you little...\n",
      "This Award is the biggest farce I ever saw.\n",
      "I've got a bone to pick with you! Then, an apology to make. Then, we exchange insurance information. Then, more bone picking!\n",
      "Bart... I haven't been selling the truffles. I've been eating them.\n",
      "My best friend is a great runner!\n",
      "Um, there's someone I forgot to thank, and he's here tonight. Krusty, will you come up on stage, please?\n",
      "Milhouse, don't you see... you're addicted to revenge.\n",
      "You may pick the bikes up in Utility Basement B.\n",
      "I've been expecting this day for thirty years. In a way, it's a relief. But in another way, it's most unwelcome.\n",
      "Finally, we're gettin' somewhere.\n",
      "Which one do you want?\n",
      "Wow Mom, great red dress!\n",
      "Hm. I never thought of fatherhood as something that could affect a kid.\n",
      "In-ground?\n",
      "Who? Lady, you got the wrong file.\n",
      "It was a beautiful wedding. I've never seen Selma happier.\n",
      "And before he broke his jaw, he never listened, but now he takes to heart everything I say.\n",
      "Wow, Krishna Krisps, Amazonkers, Lollapalollipops -- these sound like my kind of snacks...\n",
      "Why don't you file a class-action suit?\n",
      "Dwight, do something!\n",
      "Don't call me honey pie.\n",
      "Awesome! How's he getting around?\n",
      "Dear Marge, XXX. Homer.\n",
      "Serves you little punks right. Maybe next time you'll think befo--\n",
      "Off the list!\n",
      "Now we're going to leave this place. I'm sorry, Bart -- I know you've made a bug-out camp girlfriend...\n",
      "What's wrong?\n",
      "I'd like to be alone, please.\n",
      "Oh hi, Homie.\n",
      "Well, I can't compete with that!\n",
      "Marge-bot! I'm ready for some lovin'!\n",
      "It is. It is. But first let me introduce you to my family. My perfect family.\n",
      "Can't we just all supervise ourselves?\n",
      "Well, we're going to the beauty parlor. Maybe you should do something with the kids while I'm gone.\n",
      "YEAH! Damn right!\n",
      "Wah-neh! Wah-neh!\n",
      "Well, going to France sounds like a fantastic opportunity, but I think Bart should have a say in this.\n",
      "And she's ready for a night of anonymous sex with multiple partners.\n",
      "He has no friends.\n",
      "Kids, your father and I are going through a really tough time right now. And I don't know what's going to happen, but just remember that both your mom and your dad love you very very much.\n",
      "Y'know, I used to have this friend... I told him all my dreams. Really, really great kid.\n",
      "Charity, eh? Yes, I'd be more than happy to...\n",
      "Pong!\n",
      "Beat it, ducks! I'm not old enough to have food for you! I'm sexy! Young and sexy!\n",
      "Then why did you want to be with me?\n",
      "Homer! Dual incomes, no kids at two o'clock!\n",
      "Good night, Laughlin!\n",
      "Milking room? I hope you cows are decent.\n",
      "Our tandem bicycle! When I bought it, you said you'd ride with me.\n",
      "That doesn't make any sense.\n",
      "Homie?\n",
      "Have you noticed any change in Bart?\n",
      "No.\n",
      "That's him!\n",
      "What's wrong?\n",
      "If you need me, I'll be in the refrigerator.\n",
      "Huh?\n",
      "It better have.\n",
      "Mom!\n",
      "Hmmm. Guess he didn't see me.\n",
      "How you feeling, sweetie?\n",
      "Yentl? Whuzzat?\n",
      "Do you know this baby once out-raced the Flying Finn, Paavo Nurmi?\n",
      "Take me home, Artie.\n",
      "I didn't.\n",
      "Mom, I have to get to school. It's ten to three!\n",
      "And the Cosby Mysteries! That show had limitless possibilities!\n",
      "You're gonna make me give up Princess?\n",
      "Hot damn, I won! Marge, I swear I'll be the best man you ever had. It's gonna be all flowers and back rubs and how-was-your-day dear and--\n",
      "Dad, did you read all these books today?\n",
      "I carumba? Not so loud! If my Dad hears about the show, he might realize Mr. Fatso is him!\n",
      "Ooh, your blue thing with the things?\n",
      "Y'know Bart, I don't think this is such a bad present. Maybe you just shouldn't talk into it as loud as your father does.\n",
      "Good news, Lisa. I don't need your mother anymore. I've created a replacement that's superior to her in almost every way.\n",

      "Yeah, maybe it was too soon.\n",
      "Just one.\n",
      "Oh, I do. I'm just a little concerned about the kids. Maybe I should call.\n",
      "He died, Bart. Dad buried him in the back yard. But not in that order.\n",

      "Ow! Owww, my back. Dr. Steve didn't do anything.\n",
      "Shut up! I'm just giving him CPR -- the kiss of life! And if anyone loves Bart it's Nelson.\n",
      "All right, son, we just knock over this dam and the noble Native Americans can reclaim the land that is theirs.\n",
      "I hope you never say a word.\n",
      "I'm on the grass apron!\n",
      "No. Homework's not my father's specialty.\n",
      "Ahh, I love these real Saturdays. They're so relaxing. Not like that fake Saturday that almost got me fired.\n",
      "Trade you my next turn for your dessert.\n",
      "Yeah, I can't get Artie out of my head. He's like a spy in the house of Moe.\n",

      "Yeah!\n",
      "Okay. Flanders, you see...\n",
      "What th...\n",
      "It can't just be a bad day. I feel like I'm getting dumber by the minute.\n",
      "All right -- let me get my tool belt.\n",
      "Flanders! You ate my jerky!\n",
      "Dad, you shouldn't say the dog's dead when he's not.\n",
      "Quit dragging me. When I grow up, I'm gonna drag you around and buy you clothes.\n",
      "I can't believe I'm saying this, but I'm starting to regret saying Yolo.\n",
      "Well, that would be the complete dozen... All right. Rather than tempt fate, I'll move along now.\n",
      "Okay... and maybe you could cut back too.\n",
      "Okay, once more. Where are we going?\n",
      "A sprout!\n",
      "Mom, thanks to you, this box sucker didn't beat me up!\n",
      "I need a hug.\n",
      "Ooh, look at that adorable spice rack!\n",
      "But we're brother and sister.\n",
      "Oh, that's too bad.\n",
      "Ah, such an innocent time. Before cooties ravaged our community. How come we don't get together anymore?\n",
      "Uh, Nelson... for someone who never goes to the dentist, you have pretty good teeth.\n",
      "What! You can't hold me back. I'll do better, I promise.\n",
      "Wayne, maybe it's the me being still alive talking, but I think you're awesome.\n",
      "England is so classy. Every cab has its own butler.\n",
      "Sanctuary!\n",
      "Uh, yes. That must be it. This is the best of all possible worlds. Blah, blah, blah.\n",
      "Fine. Oh, I mean not good.\n",
      "But Mom, it's exactly what you wanted in a vacation. It brought us together as a family, we got a lot of good exercise outdoors, and we have so many memories.\n",
      "Oh, I don't know about this dog. He's kinda... snooty.\n",
      "Where's all the money?\n",
      "What are you crying about? How cool they are?\n",
      "I can't believe it. We won another contest!\n",
      "That's true. Will you forgive me?\n",
      "I guess you haven't heard of chloroform.\n",
      "Here's how it's gonna go down. As a family, we drive away. We cover for each other -- as a family. It's what Gabriel would have wanted.\n",
      "What's the craziest thing on the menu?\n",
      "Shut up, boy. Cheap Chinese TVs... Why did I every buy... Is that better?\n",
      "Hmmm, let's see. You got the Elephant Man, Johnny Six-Arms, Papa Smurf... these guys are pretty cool. Maybe I am one of them. If only I had some kind of proof.\n",
      "Where's your keys? I'm takin' your car to work.\n",
      "As I said, I've lost all hope.\n",
      "Mmmmm.\n",
      "Listen, we can trade Mr. Teeny for Bart. We just have to find a way to get him up there.\n",
      "Yeah, sure you did.\n",
      "I thought he was an old clump of rags.\n",
      "Kids' show.\n",
      "Mom, are you okay?\n",
      "That's Laddie. Bart says he won him at a church carnival, two towns over.\n",
      "Oh. It can't be that many. C'mon, Apu. I'll be your tutor.\n",
      "I'll just use Homer's Triple A card.\n",
      "Well, I never thought it would come to this, but I guess we'll have to sell Grandma's Civil War doll.\n",
      "Da-ad!\n",
      "Hey, I created three kids, and no one's making a big deal of that.\n",
      "Rich laughing with poor...\n",

      "Simpson!\n",

      "Aw, nuts! Extremely rare blood and I don't have it.\n",
      "Your family is invited to a free weekend at Stagnant Springs Spa.\n",
      "That's crazy talk!\n",
      "So without the kids we can have sophisticated grownup talk.\n",
      "Wait! Dr. Hibbert!\n",
      "I just lost my appetite.\n",
      "Then came the greatest thrill of my life.\n",
      "I'm not thinking that!\n",
      "Well, I think she's gonna like my hand-made birthday card better.\n",

      "No, n-n-no I know this is a-a-a tad unseemly, but if you'd just let me even out the back...\n",
      "Oh Dad, I just spent the day with the most wonderful people.\n",
      "What a delightful practically-based joke.\n",
      "Please, you've got to open that store.\n",
      "It was incredible, I saw heaven!\n",
      "... They'll fill your lives with...\n",
      "Have you ever seen such exquisite Ushabtis?\n",

      "W-well... It's a v-very generous offer, sir. But... his medical bills alone...\n",
      "Uh... I'd like some flowers.\n",
      "Where are the hounds when I need them?\n",
      "Bart, stop that! Now, we may not have antique furniture, or priceless art work, but we have everything we need right here.\n",
      "Hibbert's really losing it. We're going to Dr. Nick's.\n",
      "They're for after dinner.\n",
      "Oh, no! Dad's been drugged!\n",
      "Oh, I don't think they're gonna be that easy to lose. I mean these are professional lawmen and...\n",

      "Ew.\n",
      "... And when ye tallow hardens, we remove it from yon mold.\n",
      "Hmm. Well, I'm proud of you. You're such a good provider. Kids, come on -- thank your father for the injections!\n",
      "That's all you pay for screwing up a child for life?\n",
      "It doesn't seem possible, but I guess TV has betrayed me.\n",
      "...was in my hand...\n",
      "Oh, Maggie, you're a Simpson again!\n",
      "And now to sing you a lullaby my father sung to me:\n",
      "And that's the life of Mozart. Thank God he died young. I've gotta get dinner on the stove.\n",
      "Thanks, Mr. Burns. I owe it all to walking.\n",
      "Eh.... the boy.\n",
      "But... the TV gave me the impression that...\n",

      "I hear what you're saying, Lisa -- nothing.\n",
      "Hey, Willie. That old couple looks just like you.\n",
      "My heart was in the right place, jerk!\n",
      "Oh, yes! As long as it's tasteful... And never at someone, or with... And not...\n",
      "Forget that. I'm teaching my boy a lesson. Is she here or not?\n",
      "Did you see Daddy dance? They all saw me dance.\n",
      "And at least we can take the extra income you've earned in the last few months and set it aside for a rainy day.\n",
      "First place, here I come. Look out!\n",
      "I'm so sorry I misjudged you, Mom. You had to leave to protect your family.\n",
      "Wait, wait a minute... wait a minute. Who's General Sherman?\n",
      "Step away from the social media-enabled, peer-to-peer ride share platform!\n",
      "My God, it's beauty-ful! I-I-I finally see the goodness in myself. C'mere, you.\n",
      "Hmm, if this were a TV show that would be a helluva act break.\n",
      "Impossible! Their commercial featured a talking frog.\n",
      "Ah, I'm a little busy, Homer. Ah, you can pour it yourself.\n",
      "Oh, I'd love to, but someone made me too many pancakes and now I have to sleep them off.\n",
      "Tears of a clown.\n",
      "It's not fair! It's not fair!\n",
      "I don't know. Remember that New Year's Eve at Lenny's... he didn't even have a clock!\n",
      "...whatever the heck you're doing.\n",
      "No.\n",
      "Dad, do something!\n",

      "Hey, dinks. Whatcha dweebin'?\n",
      "It's not that I don't have a spiritual side. I just find it hard to believe there's a dead angel hanging in our garage.\n",
      "Oh yeah, like people in New Jersey have never seen a fat man makin' out. It's on the freakin' state flag.\n",

      "Dad, you could punish me. But that means you'd have to think of a punishment, sit here and make sure I do it...\n",

      "Woo hoo!\n",
      "I know, I know. Don't serve garlic... don't stab your guest in the heart with a wooden stake... don't ask him if he knows Frankenstein. It's racist somehow.\n",

      "Wow! Former president James Taylor.\n",
      "My friend and I only see it to rank on it.\n",
      "So you see Homer, revenge only leads to misery.\n",
      "Yes, if he's smart, he'll hold out for millions.\n",
      "Okay. Bart, think of a name. Make it great. Insanely, unbelievably great!\n",
      "Oh.\n",

      "Hey Dad, can I have $1,000?\n",
      "It's your new diet!\n",
      "See, Dad? Having Krabappel next door is nothing but trouble. Teachers should not be allowed to live near their students. We're natural enemies, like George Washington and Abraham Lincoln.\n",
      "I guess.\n",
      "Just like I planned.\n",
      "I want everything that's coming to Krusty the clown, which is me... Krusty.\n",

      "Oh, wake up, Ned. You think Maude isn't dating in heaven?\n",
      "Yeah, you're right.\n",
      "And Janey and I went bird watching. We saw a grackle.\n",
      "What the? I tried to do bad and I did good!\n",
      "Grampa, how'd you take off your underwear without taking off your pants?\n",
      "Great. Now my testicle's got ants on it.\n",
      "Yeah, well, the part that's showin'. I guess you could have a lot of weird scars, or a fake ass, or somethin'.\n",
      "And Dad, I hope you learned something from this.\n",
      "Oh, it's been a month. Why won't anything grow?\n",
      "Unhook it?! But I love cable.\n",
      "But Captain Murdock!\n",
      "Oh, I doubt it. But we'll let the seagulls at the dump figure it out.\n",
      "Great, dive in.\n",
      "I know what we can ask Jeeves -- why does he suck?\n",
      "No. You don't understand, Nelson. A kiss doesn't mean anything if it's dishonest.\n",
      "Maybe I should just cut my losses, give up on Lisa, and make a fresh start with Maggie.\n",
      "With all our hearts!\n",
      "Lisa, is that too spicy for you?\n",
      "No, no, no, no, no, no, no, Julio is my little secret! I've said too much!\n",
      "The mirror. The mirror!\n",
      "Take me home, Artie.\n",
      "Don't worry, Moe. I'm not bettin'.\n",
      "Where are you going? The fire's that way!\n",
      "Truly this was an act of God.\n",

      "Forever!\n",
      "You're a vampire! I should be scared, but I'm not.\n",
      "Oh well, there'll be plenty of time for explanations later. Right now, I'll be taking my puppies back.\n",
      "Hey! Don't you know it's awards season? Who's calling you at five in the morning anyway?\n",
      "Porcini --\n",
      "No you don't. Heh, heh.\n",
      "Oh honey, I'm sorry your book lady turned out to be a dinosaur. But you liked the stories when you read them, so what does it matter?\n",
      "I'll take it.\n",
      "Because I have this magical thing called a Home Equity loan. I borrow all the money I want, and the house gets stuck with the bill. Sucker.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "And I looked so good on that box.\n",
      "Come on, boy.\n",
      "Maggie's gone!\n",

      "No Doc, please! I'm just a little boy!\n",
      "Maybe I do, Chief. Maybe I do...\n",
      "Ah, grrrreetings!\n",
      "No teacher shall be held accountable if Bart Simpson dies.\n",
      "Your Honor, I'd like that last remark stricken from the record.\n",
      "Well, it would've helped if you hadn't crumpled up all the paper before we wrote anything on it.\n",

      "His name is Bart.\n",
      "our new janitor, Wade Boggs...\n",
      "Of course I can twist it, I'm great.\n",
      "From now on I'll dominate you... in ways you don't realize.\n",
      "Oh my goodness, Homer. Wake up!\n",
      "If we don't give back the money we won counting cards, the casino people are going to hurt Homer!\n",
      "Uh, we'll wait for the next one.\n",
      "Well, right now she's an out-of-work cocktail waitress. But she's going to be a country music superstar like... uh... that jerk in the cowboy hat... and that dead lady.\n",
      "Perhaps this might be appropriate.\n",
      "Wait -- they're employees! They have to be nice to us! Let's go.\n",
      "Homie! What happened to you?\n",
      "No!\n",
      "Asleep with your eyes open? Mom?\n",
      "Come on. You can do better than that.\n",
      "We listened to music radio in the car... and, since you kids behaved, we'll pick one fun thing to do here.\n",
      "Dad, I think someone's trying to kill you!\n",
      "What a lousy party.\n",
      "Ten-four, Kemosabe.\n",
      "Mmm. What do you think he's doing up there?\n",
      "What a weird looking vacuum cleaner.\n",
      "No, that ain't gonna do it.\n",
      "Sit down, Homer.\n",
      "Hitler?\n",
      "I brought these people to Springfield... and now they've taken over!\n",
      "Really?\n",
      "Look, there's Dad!\n",
      "She's gone. Can you drive me home? I'm a little drunk.\n",
      "And that's why I earn less than my white co-workers!\n",
      "Looks like that guy's got turret's syndrome!\n",
      "Make that a chocolate milk and you've got a deal.\n",
      "That'll be our Christmas card this year!\n",
      "Pretty much all my friends are divorced guys.\n",
      "Uh-oh.\n",
      "Lisa, don't you think your brother's suffered enough?\n",
      "You just don't get it, do you, Homer? You told personal things about our lives even after you promised you wouldn't. I can't trust you anymore.\n",
      "What?\n",
      "Okilly-dokilly. Oo, I better go take down the manger scene. If baby Jesus got loose, he could really do some damage.\n",
      "Did you tell the teacher?\n",
      "There are limits to how much two people should be together.\n",
      "Olympic trials, eh?\n",
      "Uh, well, your building will be fine, but unfortunately a lot of your merchandise was completely vaporized: high-end stereo equipment, size ten men's shoes...\n",
      "Huh. Didn't know they still ran those trains.\n",
      "Those dudes were... intense.\n",
      "I can't -- I promised I wouldn't.\n",
      "Dad, the mailman is here.\n",
      "Well we'll have to organize a carpool. Every day will be like a road trip!... With your dad!... To school!\n",
      "You have thirteen pickled eggs in this jar! And one cockroach!\n",
      "I spent it on beer.\n",
      "Hey, that wasn't supposed to happen! Those finks double-crossed me!\n",
      "The real magic is raising three kids in this economy! You can put the ball back now.\n",
      "The hell you are! Piracy is stealing! You're taking money out of my family's mouths.\n",
      "It's everywhere.\n",
      "Uh... uh yes, sir.\n",
      "Homie, look -- he's enjoying it.\n",
      "Look, you got us a free trip. Just slack off and cash your check like you always do.\n",
      "Oh, oh, you have to push in as you turn.\n",
      "No!\n",
      "Yahhhhhhhh!\n",
      "I'll give you this bottle of chloroform if you'll take us to The Who.\n",
      "We got the recipe from the Fruit Punch Advisory Board.\n",
      "Now, why don't you listen to the musical stylings of Mr. Lionel Richie.\n",
      "He thinks he's so big.\n",
      "Eh, God's cool.\n",
      "I want a poodle!\n",
      "Chickpea Fizz.\n",
      "Just fish... chicken... burgers... veal on Fridays... deer, but only in season... and if necessary, the sweetest meat of all... human.\n",
      "Ohh, anything, sweetheart.\n",
      "You think I don't want to? It's those TV networks, Marge. They won't let me. One quality show after another. Each one fresher and more brilliant than the last. If they only stumbled once -- just gave us thirty minutes to ourselves. But they won't, they won't let me live!\n",
      "Yes, sir!\n",
      "What?! What? What will we eat?\n",
      "Shower you with love because this experience has taught me just how precious you are.\n",
      "If that tree gets too big, it'll ruin the beauty of that rock. We'll lose tourists! And then who will buy my roadside corn?\n",
      "Don't worry, Dad, it's just a commercial. No one will remember this in fifty years.\n",
      "Mr. Gumbel, you're upsetting me.\n",
      "Yes, but they sold a bunch off to that frozen yogurt chain.\n",
      "Just help me look!\n",
      "How come you guys hesitated?\n",
      "I keep telling you, the ability to add two-digit numbers is not witchcraft!\n",
      "Oh, I don't want to go to New York City.\n",
      "I couldn't agree more. Perhaps some sort of court-appointed baby-sitter or au pair.\n",
      "We need the money, and my life is pretty boring. Last week some Jehovah's Witnesses came to the door and I wouldn't let them leave. They snuck away when I went in the kitchen to get more lemonade.\n",
      "Gee, I'm sorry, man.\n",
      "My other baby mama!\n",
      "We used our last day of summer vacation standing in this line, and now it's time for our reward.\n",
      "Oh, Marge...\n",
      "Sand... wich...\n",
      "I can't hear you.\n",
      "Look, napkins.\n",
      "My space toy!\n",
      "No, no! Yes! That's it! Bite, bite, bite!\n",
      "No, Dad.\n",
      "Well, maybe for your wedding!\n",
      "Your box made promises of a vacational nature. And I expect you to live up to them.\n",
      "All right, I'll look.\n",
      "It's not about health, Marge. It's about going crazy.\n",
      "Look alive, Simpson! I'm not paying you to goldbrick!\n",
      "Boy, get in the car. And say goodbye to your best friend forever.\n",
      "Well, you do look pretty in the moonlight.\n",
      "Yes, sir.\n",
      "Wait, dreams have rules?\n",
      "CAN'T KEEP IT IN...\n",
      "This one's mine.\n",
      "If I'm gonna tell that woman the truth, I'm gonna do it in the one place no one can ever be sad.\n",
      "Okay, so we can't go over the fence.\n",
      "One hug can't hurt!\n",
      "Race ya!\n",
      "Oh hey there, Liser. Just oiling the old door here. Finally silenced that mournful wail.\n",
      "Hey, they can't just build a parking lot on Saber Tooth Meadow. That's where they discovered all those fossils!\n",
      "Marge? Are you helping her?\n",
      "Why can't I keep the job I have now, whatever it is?\n",
      "Sure, why not.\n",
      "The undersea world certainly is full of wonders.\n",
      "I'll say. I'd really like to go out and get the mail.\n",
      "Nobody.\n",
      "Marge, let me do a solo. This could be my big break.\n",
      "Homie!\n",
      "Dad, no! It could teach us the secret of interstellar travel!\n",
      "Hear ye! Hear ye! The intergalactic jester proclaims this conformity factory closed!\n",
      "Ooh, a dancing Jesus. De-de-de-de-de-de-de-de. If there's a better use for the Internet, I haven't found it.\n",
      "Okay. All right. Okay.\n",
      "So when I took the test, the answers were stuck in my brain. It was like a whole different kind of cheating.\n",
      "Hi, Ralph... um, I just wanted to tell you there was a tooth in the valentine you gave me.\n",
      "Mmmm.\n",
      "Bart, what are you doing?\n",
      "They sound angry... and Africanized.\n",
      "It would take a man of stone with a funny bone of steel to resist that.\n",
      "Cool! / Neat-o!\n",
      "I'm sorry, sweetie. It's just a Strandie discussion group. Yes it is! We discuss why airplane go crash-crash, but people don't die-die.\n",
      "Now there's nothing to do now but sit back and wait for the kudos to roll in.\n",
      "Thank you.\n",
      "You probably would.\n",
      "J.\n",
      "You're welcome, honey.\n",
      "Flanders?! How'd you get in here? This place is a highly-sensitive area.\n",
      "Ray's not coming!\n",
      "Don't you have any sense of corporate responsibility?\n",
      "S-U-C-C-E-E-S / That's the way you spell succes--\n",
      "Then, black tie the whole deal.\n",
      "Hi, Allison? I'm Lisa Simpson. Oh, it's great to finally meet someone who converses above the normal eight-year-old-level.\n",
      "Which one's Itchy? The car?\n",
      "Can't. Frozen.\n",
      "Ooh, me too.\n",
      "These are for Lisa's class.\n",
      "Homie, everyone loved my calendar... but only you get to flip the pages.\n",
      "And this goes too.\n",
      "Oh, oh, that radio show.\n",
      "Okay, I'm leaving.\n",
      "Marge, I agree with you, in theory. In theory Communism works. In theory.\n",
      "Listen, you guys are welcome to come over and read it any time you like.\n",
      "Now, Maude, in our movie, you lay baby Moses in the basket, then put it among the reeds. Okay? Lights, camera, act - diddily-doddily-doodilly- Action Jackson!\n",
      "What? You did?\n",
      "P?! The A.A.R.P.?! Well that tears it. I don't want this milk and I'm not gonna take it back.\n",
      "I-I'd like to borrow five thousand dollars.\n",
      "Yes, you do!\n",
      "Language.\n",
      "Not yet, sir.\n",
      "All right, I get it.\n",
      "Honey, did you have any luck?\n",
      "Now to get my comic book and explore a world where no one's mad at George Lucas.\n",
      "Oh, would you two knock it off? I hate all the programs Marge likes. But it's no big deal. You know why?\n",
      "It's a father-son commitment band that I bought and never told you about!\n",
      "Bartholomew J. Simpson, how can you be so mean?\n",
      "Hmmm. What is this? Some kind of force-field around these vegetables.\n",
      "I think this is something Bart would really have enjoyed. But it's the only way he'll learn.\n",
      "Lisa, will you keep it down!? I'm making a crank phone call to Principal Skinner.\n",
      "Woo hoo! Homer Simpson with the pick!\n",
      "So we need one meat sock on the payroll. But who?\n",
      "Dad, we've never been too close, have we?\n",
      "The whole town's laughin' at me. Even that cat out there. Bart, kill that cat!\n",
      "All right. I'd like to sign my daughter up for lessons, Vicki.\n",
      "Are the Pope's tweets infallible?\n",
      "I'm only one man, Marge.\n",
      "Principal Skinner is having second thoughts? Poor Edna!\n",
      "Lisa, what's wrong?\n",
      "Microatia? That's twelve thousand miles away.\n",
      "I can't come up with an idea for my homecoming float. Do it for me.\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "Mom! Bart implied I was a warthog!\n",
      "Oh, I'll never forget my carefree boyhood days on this old boardwalk...\n",
      "Is there room in the head bag, Smithers?\n",
      "Eh, I can't afford it.\n",
      "I wouldn't say I paid someone to be your friend. I just gave her money for records and ice cream.\n",
      "Marge, I'll be on my best behavior -- you have my word as a gentleman and a lady. Now let's see, which rifle should I bring?\n",
      "Be intimate with Marge.\n",
      "Okay, I just have to keep these tipsy witches safe for ten more seconds.\n",
      "What? Now? Why?\n",
      "It's okay. We're married.\n",
      "Uh-oh.\n",
      "Ned, that's so considerate.\n",
      "Knock it off!\n",
      "Woo-hoo!\n",
      "Oh yeah?\n",
      "Ah, reckless youth.\n",
      "You... let... go...\n",
      "A lot of good backups. How pregnant is the raccoon?\n",
      "Honey... we'd love to, but... a prize-winning bull is thousands of dollars.\n",
      "Woo hoo!\n",
      "My compliments to the delivery boy.\n",
      "I've said it before and I'll say it again... Aye carumba!\n",
      "There's no cut on your cheek...\n",
      "What's the matter, sweetie?\n",
      "Yeah, native Americans like us.\n",
      "I'll be in my room.\n",
      "Homer!\n",
      "Nothing. Just sit. I'll be back.\n",
      "You should've seen the look on Krabappel's face!\n",
      "Yello?... It's for you.\n",
      "I'm not a hoarder! Do the Yankees hoard pennants? Does Marrakesh hoard intrigue?\n",
      "Oh! This is the best present I ever got. Thank you, Bart. Thank you Michael.\n",
      "I don't know about this, Dad. Shouldn't we give the money to charity or some...? Ow!\n",
      "Forget it. I'd rather get a zero.\n",
      "Wow, the killers have been kind to me... while the people who were supposed to protect me treated me like dirt! What kind of a world is this?\n",
      "What'd I miss?\n",
      "Sorry, Bart. Your mother bought us tickets to a snooty movie directed by some Swedish meatball.\n",
      "Whaa?\n",
      "You gonna bribe 'em?\n",
      "But those other girls are prettier than me.\n",
      "Ya-huh!\n",
      "Yes, ma'am.\n",
      "Back to the car.\n",
      "I love you, son.\n",
      "I'm the king of goofing off!\n",
      "And that's not your strong suit, big guy.\n",
      "Never mind.\n",
      "Oh, no. A salesbot!\n",
      "That's okay.\n",
      "Sure.\n",
      "I said, are there any areas that we, his parents, can improve upon?\n",
      "Sir, yes sir! Luckily, I am now trained in six additional forms of unarmed combat, sir!\n",
      "Cut it off, but be careful.\n",
      "But... I deserve... acknowledgement...\n",
      "Are you kidding? Lisa turned out perfect. I won't stand here and listen to you bad-mouthing Lisa!\n",
      "That's my little slugger.\n",
      "That little punk. I'll teach him some manners.\n",
      "Implied, Lisa? Or implode?\n",
      "Uh, sure... let me write you a check.\n",
      "He's adorable! I'd sure like to tuck that in at night.\n",
      "Well, at least they left your underwear on. That was nice of them.\n",
      "Teachers. You don't have the guts to strike.\n",
      "Nah, just your screwy country.\n",
      "Hang on. Wait a minute.\n",
      "I think we should try to restore Bart's faith in Buck. And we could start by getting Buck to quit drinking.\n",
      "Do do do do do...\n",
      "Yeah. I made a great film, but I'm havin' trouble gettin' it out there. I'm like Michael Moore, except I'm skinny, my jeans are washed, and God loves me. I just wish I could find some way to spread my message.\n",
      "I'm sorry.\n",
      "Nelson, how was your summer?\n",
      "Yeah, and I could really use your help.\n",
      "Your stupid invention made me realize my life is worthless!\n",
      "Sgt. Skinner was a hero. He risked capture many times behind enemy lines.\n",
      "Yeah, I know, Homer.\n",
      "That was an amazing throw.\n",
      "The eggs are supposed to be tossed between students, not at the principal. Once more and hurl!\n",
      "Yeah, it's my code name. This is Compost. And this is Solarpanel.\n",
      "No way. C'mon, quit hoggin' the gun.\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Ideally no, but...\n",
      "You're experiencing spiritual emptiness because your power has isolated you from other human beings.\n",
      "How could I confuse bus 22 with bus 22A?\n",
      "Hey you can't come in here dressed like that.\n",
      "You get the same results with a mincing gel.\n",
      "Oh my God! I know that kid! We've gotta help him!\n",
      "Sorry.\n",
      "Yeah, go on.\n",
      "Hey!\n",
      "I call the big one Bitey.\n",
      "Hm, yeah.\n",
      "Shhh, quiet Lisa.\n",
      "Yeah, I do know a lot about nuclears.\n",
      "I've got no time for your demented parlor games! You won't be telling anyone else that Homer Simpson shot you.\n",
      "Now to put this tape where no one will ever listen to it.\n",
      "Quick, in here!\n",
      "Oh my God! I'm not dead!\n",
      "You know if you need a hat check girl, I've got a daughter.\n",
      "Hmmm. Well as long as I'm asking something, can I ask him to assuage my fears that he's contaminating the planet in a manner that may one day render it uninhabitable?\n",
      "Where do you get your money?\n",
      "Aw, thanks. Now how 'bout a dance with your Daddy?\n",
      "Good news, everyone. I got in a fight with the garbage men and they're cutting off our service.\n",
      "Uh, long story. Uh, we were trying to impress some girls -- and things kinda got away from us.\n",
      "It means these two fabulous babes are staying for dinner.\n",
      "There's a happy baby. Aren't you? Aren't you?\n",
      "This winning cornucopia is magnificent.\n",
      "The last place I saw it...\n",
      "Will cash be okay?\n",
      "Oh, these fortunes are terrible.\n",
      "Thanks.\n",
      "You grab a bucket and a brush and clean harder and faster than you ever have before.\n",
      "You can't close! I'll have to go home and drink better beer at half the price in natural lighting!\n",
      "I wonder if he's going to say anything about that horrible fish.\n",
      "That's okay. I'll just push the button for the stimulator, I mean elevator.\n",
      "Well, I suppose I could just skip college and marry Milhouse...\n",
      "Homer, this thing with your Dad has had you moping around the house for days. I think it's time for you to talk to someone who understands.\n",
      "I'll do anything but sing!\n",
      "Oooh, back on the saddle she climbs.\n",
      "Smithers, I've just seen the most heroic dog on television. He pulled a toddler from the path of a speeding car, then pushed a criminal in front of it. Find this dog. I want to make him my executive vice president.\n",
      "Mr. Bergstrom! Hey, Mr. Bergstrom!\n",
      "They didn't have any aspirin, so I got you some cigarettes.\n",
      "Really, why?\n",
      "Excuse me, uh, Pharaoh? I think Moses here has something to ask you. Go.\n",
      "Another thing that would be harder with four kids.\n",
      "So anyway, uh, your movie's wrapping up soon. I guess you'll be headin' out on the first bus to the airport. If you ride with a friend, you can save twenty bucks!\n",
      "Oh, my best dress.\n",
      "Oh, right.\n",
      "Yeah, tell it, Mom.\n",
      "I gotta go.\n",
      "Homer, that was rude and shortsighted. Patty and Selma have the map.\n",
      "A whole weekend? I don't know...\n",
      "Anything, huh? Okay... I want pizza, and I want it delivered by Krusty the Clown.\n",
      "The end of the world as we know it?\n",
      "Cowabunga, dude!\n",
      "But you're just perpetuating a negative Italian-American stereotype. I mean, you could be a pizza man, organ grinder, uh... leaning tower maker... and... did I say pizza man?\n",
      "Whoa, whoa, whoa, now I gotta find a friend?\n",
      "Curtain puller?!\n",
      "Eh, nothing we can do.\n",
      "What's that, sonny?\n",
      "What? Gimme that.\n",
      "Bart! We did it! Now we get to keep our house, and you get to go back to fourth grade!\n",
      "Yeah, that's me all right. And the guy standing next to me is President Gerald Ford. And this is when I was on tour with The Smashing Pumpkins. Oh, and here's a picture of me in outer space.\n",
      "You're right, Marge. Good work, boy.\n",
      "This guy sucks. He can barely make it to the top.\n",
      "No! Wait! Wait! Bullfighting is a cruel, pseudo-sport!\n",
      "I'm not worried, Lis. You know why? Because of this...\n",
      "Dad, no!\n",
      "You told me you liked it! You didn't read it at all! You lied to me!\n",
      "I'm good for the rest, you know I am.\n",
      "Aw, we're gonna die and I never tasted canteloupe.\n",
      "What kind of insane parking system is designed so you're blocked in by everyone that arrived after you?!\n",
      "Will do!\n",
      "What's so funny?\n",
      "All you have to do is sign a paper that says I can have your soul. I need a soul, Ralph. Any soul. Yours.\n",
      "No, no, no. No, ask your heart what its fondest desire is.\n",
      "And that kind of stuff is worth money?\n",
      "Three... two... one... it's Ash Wednesday everybody! Set down your gins and confess your sins!\n",
      "Very true.\n",
      "Lis, I've learned a valuable lesson here: the pen is mightier than the flaming bag of poop.\n",
      "I got the job. I got the job! Whoo hoo! Only in America could I get a job!\n",
      "For your information, I am not a loser! I'm a successful principal who paints houses in the summertime.\n",
      "Wait, wait, wait, there's one thing I don't understand here.\n",
      "My new best friend isn't what I thought. She's a... Republican.\n",
      "Family outing? I'll start -- Lisa's gay!\n",
      "Uh, honey, there's a point in every father's life when he blows up his daughter's room.\n",
      "Lisa! My goodness! That's very impressive!\n",
      "Okay, Lisa. I've got Furious D across the board, boxed with the three and the eight, and wheeled up and down.\n",
      "You're gonna have to deal with more nonsense like that.\n",
      "No it's not!\n",
      "What's goin' on?\n",
      "Hello. Hello. I'm-I'm Marge Simpson. And I'm here to talk about a-a-a wonderful, beautiful thing--\n",
      "Yes. You are right, Milhouse. It is a fake. Which makes it a fake I.D.\n",
      "Homie, I think the kids are just hungry.\n",

      "That was my plan all along. Now relax and the currents will take us home.\n",
      "Oh, let's just take it from the top.\n",
      "I'm tired. I'm hungry. Can't we just buy a new house?\n",
      "...and your infinite patience with a big, dumb jerk like me. Oh, Ned, I don't deserve you as a neighbor, but will you forgive a young, handsome fool and come home?\n",
      "Oh, you'd like that, wouldn't you?\n",
      "You really care, man. A lot of bullies just phone it in. Kearney.\n",

      "Get 'em off me! Get 'em off! Aaah!\n",
      "Kids, your mom is with another man, and I need you to help me find out who he is. Hm... is this really something I should show you kids?\n",
      "Hello?\n",
      "There you go. There you go. You too...\n",
      "That's it. We're going downtown to get our kids back. Right now!\n",
      "Yes, sir. It was a beautiful Sunday afternoon. I was playing in my wholesome childlike way, little realizing that I was about to be struck down by the Luxury Car of Death.\n",
      "I'm here for my free birthday sundae.\n",
      "Aw, poor Maggie.\n",
      "But your song said you liked Springfield.\n",

      "Then I'm going with you!\n",
      "Well, that's one of them!\n",
      "All right, I'm in. I'll humiliate the love of your life. Because I like you, I'll even do it pro boner.\n",
      "Feeling better, Super Dad?\n",
      "That's us!\n",
      "Won't... dignify that... with response.\n",
      "Great debut, son. You really settled in after some early jitters.\n",
      "Oh my God. He's talking to me.\n",
      "Well, I guess Macy's and Gimbel's learned to live side by side.\n",
      "Gotta go.\n",
      "Well, what do you call it?\n",
      "Yeah, I wanted to spend Christmas with you guys.\n",
      "That's quite a tale, Grampa.\n",
      "You'll understand one day when you have kids of your own.\n",
      "Hello! Why it's... it's uh... oh it's...\n",
      "Oh Mom, those loggers chopped down the tree! Why did I have to leave my post?\n",
      "And he said if we went to the cops, he'd come back for Maggie.\n",
      "I'm not racing! It's me, Marge Simpson!\n",
      "Marge?... Lisa?... Flanders?...\n",
      "So Milhouse got the redemption he deserved... and so, in a way, did Bart.\n",
      "Mr. Ploot? Homer Simpson here. When you sold me this house you forgot to mention one little thing. You didn't tell me it was built on an Indian burial ground. No you didn't! Well, that's not my recollection... Yeah! Well... all right, goodbye. He says he mentioned it five or six times.\n",
      "You don't have the intelligence to rig an election by yourself, do you?\n",
      "Nice going there, Homer.\n",
      "Oh, very much so, but as long as we handle this in a mature and, above all, quiet manner, we'll still get that grant money. Oh, you really scared me there.\n",
      "Uh, I wouldn't eat them peanuts. They're uh, they're spit-backs.\n",
      "Solve your problem, Milhouse?\n",
      "What's inside?\n",
      "Dad, it's just that too much of your love can really be... scary.\n",
      "Never mind. Looks like the Flanders' are gonna get those seats anyway.\n",
      "Well, I guess that's it. People like us can't afford justice. Come on Homie, let's go before he fires you too.\n",
      "Go on, Bart. No time like the present.\n",
      "Marge please, control your jealousy. This is your daughter!\n",
      "Oh, I'm not doing this for the money. I'm just happy knowing that future generations will enjoy unspoiled median strips and pristine highway embankments.\n",
      "Uh, yeah, um, uh as a change of pace, I'm gonna let you do most of the work. I think you're ready for it, Alan.\n",
      "Hank?! Hank who?\n",
      "Oh Homer, that's ridiculous. Bart, instead of fighting, why don't you try a little understanding?\n",
      "Bart, did your mystical Jewish monster beat up those bullies?\n",
      "Well, here we are!\n",
      "Keep up the good work, toots.\n",
      "I'll give it one marathon.\n",
      "Or swindling our neighbors.\n",
      "Aha!\n",
      "Have a good day, you two! Don't be me!\n",
      "They better be for a hundred and twenty-five big ones!\n",
      "Another beer, Dad?\n",
      "Mom, I wanna be just like you. I mean the lava part, not saving Lisa.\n",
      "I gotta go shake the dew off the lilly.\n",
      "Oh my, what's that thing you're doing?\n",
      "Yes we are.\n",
      "Fish scales?\n",
      "Who are you?\n",
      "Woo hoo! I won!\n",
      "Take it!\n",
      "Do you want the Golden Globe?\n",
      "Marge, Homer, this marital discord is perfect. But please, save it for home where your son could see it.\n",
      "Look at them all, through the darkness I'm bringing. They're not sad at all, they're actually singing! They sing without juicers! They sing without blenders! They sing without flunjers, capdabblers and smendlers! Tell Simpson I'm ready to deal\n",
      "Uh, could I just get a look at that?\n",
      "You like parties, huh? Well, I just remembered they're having a big one down at the waterfront this weekend.\n",
      "Are you sure you don't want to go to a doctor? I mean, a drawbridge did close on your head.\n",
      "He's the bestest dog ever. He's light brown and he has a spot on him shaped like a heart.\n",
      "But?\n",
      "We promise.\n",
      "That's it! We're outta here.\n",
      "It's close, but no.\n",
      "Quite preposterous. But no one will believe me until I can prove what it really is. Can't you do a DNA test or something?\n",
      "You are? Hm, which will win out? My old-fashioned prejudices or the fact that I've already mixed my laundry with yours. I'll have to sleep on it.\n",
      "Dad, you did it! I am so proud of you.\n",
      "Well, I'm sure our town's police force will handle this competently.\n",
      "Yeah, well Lenny said it.\n",
      "You're not listening. You're only hearing what you want to hear.\n",
      "Hmm, inconclusive.\n",
      "Here's my test.\n",
      "Oh, my God.\n",
      "Who is that?!\n",
      "Oh, can we keep him Dad, please?\n",
      "Hello, Mr. Burns, this is the kidnapper. Do you miss your son?\n",
      "Come on, Touch of death. Touch of death. Touch of death.\n",
      "Eat my dust, dust!\n",
      "You told me he was at culinary school!\n",
      "That's what I assumed.\n",
      "Uh-oh.\n",
      "If I tug the bill of my cap like so...\n",
      "Really? But the franchise agreement says Mother Hubbard Inc. would provide adequate training for all employees, which they didn't. Clause twenty-seven C-3.\n",
      "Uh, I think it might be time to hang up the ol' beaded seat cover there.\n",
      "Oh sure, you take his side. Just 'cause he bought you that house on St. James Place.\n",
      "Your voice is so gravelly, just like Lauren Bacall's.\n",
      "Look, I want a baby brother, but I can't get my parents to do it.\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Yes, I do.\n",
      "That's your hat!\n",
      "The secret is don't read the comment cards.\n",
      "Urge to kill fading, fading...\n",
      "Yeah. It sounded like naked bacon to me. I don't know why they say you're the dumb guy, Tom.\n",
      "So, when you take your practice test, take your number two pencil and...\n",
      "For Marge?\n",
      "Ooh! Ooh! Okay, the face!\n",
      "No way.\n",
      "If you don't want to say it, just think it.\n",
      "So, Trent, where's the party bus headed now?\n",
      "Jimminy Kimmel! Look how much they're charging for Bart's treatment!\n",
      "Mmm-hmm. Very much. And your laugh...\n",
      "Everyone got an assignment but us.\n",
      "Lisa's going somewhere after school two days a week. And all we have are boxing wizards. If we're gonna find out what Lisa's up to, I'll need the help of all her old boyfriends.\n",
      "He ruined the wedding -- getting his revenge on us at last!\n",
      "Maggie, you're swimming! You swam out to save me.\n",
      "Homer, wait. Herb, what're you talking about?\n",
      "Fetch, boy!\n",
      "C'mon, boy. I know you're scared, but you can do this. I believe in you!\n",
      "Look, I know this wasn't the greatest outing, but your father meant well, so don't let him know that we didn't .\n",
      "Oh, we stopped those when the kids said I was too fat to carry.\n",
      "That was the idea.\n",
      "How did Santa's Little Helper get in there?\n",
      "He's in for some lovin'.\n",
      "Kick him in the ribs...\n",
      "That's from the first Amendment to the Constitution. Thank you.\n",
      "I know how to cheer you up.\n",
      "Yes, yes, I did. I was told to.\n",
      "Another beer, Moe.\n",
      "Yeah, but what does not kill me makes me stronger. Wow, that was a lot of words -- I need some energy.\n",
      "What kind of parents would permit such a lapse in scalpel hygiene?\n",
      "Why don't you dance? Dance?!\n",
      "Well, he is building a soapbox derby racer.\n",
      "Grandma, I accept your gift.\n",
      "Sorry.\n",
      "That could've been my motherboard lying in the street!\n",
      "All right, Fat Tony. If it's trouble with Quimby you're after--\n",
      "Well, uh, okay. What the heck, I've earned a little break.\n",
      "Well, that didn't work.\n",
      "What are you talking about?\n",
      "Now Homer, you do have big bones.\n",
      "Kill 'em!\n",
      "You're right. We have to do something. Let's watch TV!\n",
      "Oh my God! This counts as exercise? I'm barely moving and I'm smelling Cinnebun. Sometimes you have to wait till you're thirty-eight to discover who you really are. I'm a seventy-nine-year-old man!\n",
      "In the olden times, if you were watching TV and nature called, you'd have to get up and walk to the bathroom. It was the hardest thing in the world to do. But now, with the Lazy Man Reclining Toilet Chair, you can just lean back and let 'er rip.\n",
      "Maybe... but maybe, we don't want to be Stonecutters no more.\n",
      "Were falcons involved in any way?\n",
      "Those jets keep going lower and lower.\n",
      "Next song. / That's what I meant. / Absolutely.\n",

      "Harms no one? Explain that to... well what about... I think you forgot about... Hmm...\n",
      "Oh, nothing... How would you feel if I did some volunteer work at the prison?\n",
      "Uh, you missed the turn-off, Mr. Warren.\n",
      "WE OUGHTA DROWN YOU JUST LIKE CATS!\n",
      "Lisa, honey, you're forgetting the beer. It comes in seventy-two ounce tubs here.\n",
      "They're pretty funny. Once I used one on Milhouse. He was wishing for his parents to get back together, but the flame never went out.\n",
      "Oh, you're right. This farm's hopeless. Why didn't I listen to those inbred hicks? I guess I'll just go hang myself in the barn.\n",
      "Just call me Fireman Skinner.\n",
      "Well, in bowling ability.\n",
      "Bravo!\n",
      "Weaving?!\n",
      "IT'S STILL ON / IN MY HEAD / IT WILL BE THERE TILL I'M DEAD...\n",

      "That seems about right.\n",
      "I get it. I get it. That's your thing.\n",
      "Thanks, Freakazoid. I'd just like to say that there's one person to whom I really owe my newfound success: Marge Simpson.\n",
      "I can understand how they wouldn't let in those wild jungle apes, but what about those really smart ones who live among us -- who roller skate and smoke cigars?\n",
      "Um... will you marry me?\n",

      "Ms. Dubinsky, can you please just tell us why you hate Krusty?\n",

      "No, Dad. He's grooming him.\n",
      "Okay, well, I really enjoyed being you, Dr. Hibbert. Uh, oh by the way, you're not welcome in the library no more. I'm sorry.\n",
      "That river led to the reservoir -- which made anyone who drank the town's tap water also go temporarily blind.\n",
      "Oh no, not the good cheek!\n",
      "No! That's impossible! He's dead! I lay a saxophone reed at his grave every year.\n",
      "It hurts when I swallow.\n",
      "Hey, nobody calls Moe St. Cool a phony.\n",
      "All right... but don't be shocked.\n",
      "I guess my life isn't so bad. With the help of my loving family, I even published my first book...and I've finally reached a state of serenity and-- another spider!\n",
      "You think so?\n",
      "Here you go. Put those in the trash, then you can help me unload the dishwasher.\n",
      "As I lay dying on the ocean floor, I remembered everything you've done for me. To Hell with that stupid DNA test and its ninety-nine point nine, nine, nine, nine, seven per cent accuracy -- you're my dad, and I love you.\n",
      "Promise me.\n",
      "Did anyone order a hero?\n",
      "Because we do our sleuthing in Mother's Nissan Quest Minivan.\n",
      "Will you take us to Mt. Splashmore?\n",
      "All right, Mr. Smartenheimer, that does it!\n",
      "Don't worry, Principal Skinner.\n",
      "Okay, now look. My boss is gonna be at this picnic, so I want you to show your father some love and/or respect.\n",
      "Nah.\n",

      "But you're so much more... ravaged than I am.\n",

      "...twenty-five dollar casino chip...\n",
      "I must apologize for my husband.\n",

      "Eh, bound to happen.\n",
      "Well, they're hardly worth a Smithers, but we don't have all night. Can you beat nine high?\n",
      "I'm busy.\n",
      "But what if they try to talk us into something?\n",
      "Dad... I don't know how to say this, but I don't want to drive your car. It's slow, it's ugly, it handles like a shopping cart...\n",
      "Hi, guys, what are you doing?\n",
      "Boy, a man on a Squishee-bender can sure do some crazy things.\n",
      "Great. That's great. But I have to get to work in the morning.\n",
      "Huh uh.\n",
      "No!\n",
      "I better check on my elf-self!\n",
      "Oh, no. Me bring Homer on a rafting trip?\n",
      "Y'know, Marge. Bart's really gonna like my birthday present this year. It won't be like those shoe trees I got him last year... or the shelf paper I bought him for Christmas. I'll buy his love yet.\n",
      "Squawky?\n",
      "On a night like tonight I have to believe there are.\n",

      "Those aren't the dog's eyes, are they?\n",
      "Get him, Sheeba!\n",
      "There must be some mistake. We, uh, we make cookies here. Mr. Burns' old fashioned, good time, extra chewy...\n",
      "There's a trickle-down theory here. If I'm happy, I'm less abusive to the rest of you.\n",
      "I don't have to be careful, I got a gun.\n",
      "Class, starting today we will be presenting an alternative theory on the origin of man.\n",
      "Oh, for crying out loud... I--\n",
      "On the street in your mind.\n",
      "What's the big problem?\n",
      "Oh, come on, Marge. Why scrimp now on the off-chance that they'll actually get in someplace?\n",
      "Marge!\n",
      "Still fits.\n",
      "I hate to rain on your parade, lady, but this is my grave. Hey, wait a minute... Mom?\n",
      "Please.\n",
      "No. I mean ketchup.\n",
      "Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, save your breath.\n",
      "Ooh, and such delicate tissue paper. Zig-Zag!?\n",

      "It's the beating of that hideous heart! I mean, I think I hear something.\n",
      "Ah. 206 bones... fifty miles of small intestine... full, pouting lips. Why, this fellow is less a snowman than a god.\n",
      "Amen! Well, Bart, has Dr. Hibbert made his point?\n",
      "Huh?!\n",
      "I don't know. I flunked Latin, too.\n",
      "Should we take all our stuff, or are we coming back on this boat too?\n",
      "Queen of Hearts. I believe all the rest are ours.\n",
      "Oh yeah, that's why.\n",
      "That's better. Now, let's role... play!\n",
      "Thank you so much, Mister...\n",
      "Good morning, Trash Pile. How's about...\n",
      "Sure.\n",
      "Oh, how to explain this to a child... Hm... Future Daddy needs to double-kill these corpses so they won't come back as zombies, and-- Get 'im!\n",
      "The Harpooned Heart. Book on tape! As read by Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen.\n",
      "Shut up, old man.\n",
      "Uh, can't. I've got to go distract bulls at a rodeo.\n",
      "Uh, Pittsburgh thirty-five, Dallas thirty-one!\n",
      "Homie, is that you?\n",
      "Homer, there's no reason for you to feel threatened. You'll always be the man of this house.\n",
      "Let's talk about somethin' else. Something nice.\n",
      "Quit following me, you coward!\n",
      "Ah, that's my girl.\n",
      "Marge, when I'm with you, I get that feeling like when I got that smart kid's report card by mistake. For a minute, I thought I had all A's. And that my name was Howard Simberg.\n",
      "Check it out: the gallery was gonna throw these paintings overboard, like they were worthless garbage?\n",
      "Mom, please. I'm playing a video game.\n",
      "Mmm... fifty dollar pretzel. Hey, what's Baby Huey doing?\n",
      "Clumsy Homer... Everything's always my fault... If he'd just watch where he was going...\n",
      "Note to self: stop doing anything.\n",
      "Lisa? Lisa? Lisa!\n",
      "Hot! Hot! Hot! Warm, tepid, cool, cold... so cold!\n",
      "I know I said that, but what I secretly meant was...\n",
      "You've got yourself a narc.\n",
      "We were just having fun. Don't get upset.\n",
      "Even the sea won't forgive me.\n",
      "Wow, Marge. I can't believe you're taking me to a sports bar.\n",
      "You're not leaving me?\n",
      "So am I.\n",
      "Hasn't this experience taught you you can't believe everything you hear?\n",
      "Why you--\n",
      "It's fun to cook dinner together. Homer and I never do it anymore. Cook together, that is.\n",
      "Gee, she didn't seem angry, or anything. Maybe she doesn't care anymore!\n",
      "Oh, you haven't seen Bart for a few hours, so you automatically assume I let something terrible happen.\n",
      "Keep moving, deadbeat -- cash only.\n",
      "Uh, uh, huh, oh, hey, Rachel. W-Well what do you know? We both like plain vanilla with nothing on it.\n",
      "Perfect. Bad movie, bad pun, even bad paper stock.\n",
      "Why would Sideshow Bob go so nuts over a fireplace?\n",
      "Hm. We need a better idea. We'll have to find the town's smartest men.\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "Stay out of this, old man.\n",
      "It fell off a truck-truck truck.\n",
      "This isn't the line for a movie. Why are you wearing that costume?\n",
      "Where'd the blood come from?\n",
      "You live like this?\n",
      "Well... she's pretty healthy for someone who's been living with cooties.\n",
      "Yes, that describes Kathy in Personnel to a tee!\n",
      "Well Mother, I would like you to meet, Milhouse, Lewis, Richard and... Bart Simpson.\n",
      "I thought there was no crime in New York any more. Giulianiii!\n",
      "Even the pet cemetery voted for Bob! Look! Mr. and Mrs. Bananas! Humphrey Boa-gart!\n",
      "Marge, please don't humiliate me in front of the money.\n",
      "Whoa, whoa, whoa! Before I let a Holy Joe walk in this bar, I've gotta know which of the two true faiths you represent.\n",
      "What?\n",
      "Heh heh heh heh. Sweet.\n",
      "How could my Dad go out with Selma? Don't those two gargoyles know that love is for good-looking young people?\n",
      "Whoooooaaaa!\n",
      "Why would Willie do that?\n",
      "Oh, Grampa, you're not busy are you?\n",
      "Well, uh, I was just leaving, but Moe... had an accident.\n",
      "No way, man!\n",
      "I'm gonna put him on the air tonight, live.\n",
      "Oh no, my quarterback. What are we gonna do?\n",
      "Sheesh, look at these refugees. How 'bout a smile?\n",
      "Ew... so, do you think my family will ever forgive me for making them a laughing stock?\n",
      "Don't you dare post that review.\n",
      "There's no detention this time, Simpson. This is the end. You are expelled from Springfield Elementary!\n",
      "Hey, kids! Have you seen your mother?\n",
      "Dad! Funtendo is unveiling their new system in three minutes -- in Hall G!\n",
      "Bart? You're home!\n",
      "Sure, we lied. We lied so we could spend a single night as a married couple without worrying about you kids!\n",
      "What do you mean?\n",
      "Bob, look!\n",
      "Oh, precious heirlooms! Daddy would never let them take you.\n",
      "Well, I'm afraid I had some great plans, too.\n",
      "For your information, I've been taking steps to become a better father.\n",
      "Yes, son.\n",
      "Yeah!\n",
      "May firrr... seconnn... thirrr...\n",
      "Oh, there's my sweet little Maggie.\n",
      "Apu. You can take this job and re-staff it!\n",
      "Hey, that's great. G'night.\n",
      "Woo hoo! But why?\n",
      "Don't patronize me, doctor.\n",
      "Dad, I'm impressed! You've become a much better referee.\n",
      "Arrrgh!\n",
      "Up-bup-bup! Don't eat that, sweetie, it's poison.\n",
      "Hey, Krusty's in an opera, here in Rome! He can save our lives! Come on, let's go!\n",
      "I can't! That fire siren could sound at any moment.\n",
      "Yes, Kent?\n",
      "Stop it, Winston!\n",
      "Those baby whales are doomed, just like their mom. I guess it's just nature's way.\n",
      "Yeah, well Bart can kiss my hairy yellow butt.\n",
      "I've outgrown you!\n",
      "Bart, run like the wind!\n",
      "The Ribwich! The commercials have come to pass!\n",
      "Then I'd like to legally change my name.\n",
      "And miss the back half of Jimmy Kimmel? That's when he experiments, boy.\n",
      "No problemo. Where's the can opener?\n",
      "I'm an orphan!\n",
      "Well, you have such a beautiful voice...\n",
      "Where's the hammer?!\n",
      "That sounds like a good movie.\n",
      "Uh-huh... uh-huh...\n",
      "Marge, don't flake out on me. That monkey's paw is gonna make our dreams come true.\n",
      "Better get the ol' snow shovel back from Homer, huh?\n",
      "Blow up the hospital.\n",
      "It's great. It's really great.\n",
      "Hmm, that's odd. Usually the blood gets off at the second floor.\n",
      "Wait. What? No!\n",
      "Woo-hoo!\n",
      "Here, I'll be the demon, you be the thimble.\n",
      "Relax. This is cinema verite. When the brutal slow-motion killing starts, I'll tell you to shut your eyes.\n",
      "They're not very...\n",
      "For the past week I've been carrying around this bag of sugar. It's taught me how to love and care for a child.\n",
      "That's an entry?! I thought it was garbage.\n",
      "Homer! We only have five minutes until the school bus comes.\n",
      "Mm-hmm.\n",
      "Great story, lady.\n",
      "I could walk up to the President and blow smoke in his stupid monkey face and he'd just have to sit there groovin' on it.\n",
      "You're slow to react, Dad.\n",
      "Cut it out. You're not a teacher anymore.\n",
      "Marge, look. This has spring snakes inside, but the suckers will think it's Beer Nuts. Mmm... Beer Nuts.\n",
      "Ah, that's gotta hoit!\n",
      "No, thanks!\n",
      "Where are we?\n",
      "Kids, I have to tell your Mom I lost Maggie.\n",
      "He spanked you? You, Bart Simpson?\n",
      "One of those cyber smoochers wrote me back...\n",
      "How does that make him a hero?\n",
      "Six. Seven if there's something good on.\n",
      "Oh God, the press is gonna have a field day with this.\n",
      "No. I mean for adult males.\n",
      "I'm not spending my precious Saturday chauffeuring those over-privileged kids to a better life than I ever had.\n",
      "Well, boys, who'd have thought learning about religion could be fun?\n",
      "Huh?\n",
      "Ba-rt stop it!\n",
      "Why couldn't I be eaten by a giraffe? That would be fun!\n",
      "Oh, Bart. I know you're still getting adjusted here. Tell you what. We'll do whatever you want to do.\n",
      "Kids, will you come in here?\n",
      "Oooh, there's Krusty the Clown! Krusty, Krusty, say something funny.\n",
      "Why you little...\n",
      "I love the theater.\n",
      "NOW, WHAT YOU GOTTA DO / IF YOU WANT TO GET A KISS / IS ACT REAL SMOOTH / AND MAKE YOUR MOVE LIKE THIS.\n",
      "The Dome of the Rock? Messiah, away!\n",
      "I don't like this -- real humor comes from people being nice to each other.\n",
      "Aw, look at 'em, sleeping like little angels. Spare no one.\n",
      "You're saying it like it happens all the time. And by the way, the paint's a little faded on my parking spot. You call this a Platinum Club experience?\n",
      "Wow! You made me a sculpture of Magilla Gorilla.\n",
      "I wanted to surprise you. I couldn't very well chop your hand off and bring it to the store, could I?\n",
      "Mom! Dad!\n",
      "Sorry I'm late -- I was in a car crash. Many hurt, but nobody cool was harmed.\n",
      "That sounds awfully harsh.\n",
      "But it says here in the brochure...\n",
      "Thanks boy. Now be careful when you...\n",
      "Branch monster.\n",
      "Secrets? I have no secrets! Just enjoy this golden time you will soon cling desperately to the memory of. Smell some bread!\n",
      "It's not gambling! It's math.\n",
      "Good night, Maggie.\n",
      "I was trying to punish him exactly like you would. So, in a way, you really dropped the ball on this one. This is your mess and I'll be damned if I'm gonna clean it up!\n",
      "Oh, I hate having two heads.\n",
      "Oh... I love you, Edna Krabappel.\n",
      "Relax, everybody! The Navitron Auto-Drive System is driving the truck for me! But keep it a secret! It's a big scam! Okay?\n",
      "Yeah, yeah, yeah. Just remember, if your mother asks, I took you to a wine tasting.\n",
      "French it up, lover boy!\n",
      "Oh, oh, oh, I have a better idea -- let's spend the night together, right here.\n",
      "Yep.\n",
      "Pigabar? What the hell is pigabar?\n",
      "Sounds scrump-didly-umptious, dear old Daddly-doodly.\n",
      "The kids at school were even worse.\n",
      "Stop talking like that! Stop it!\n",
      "Like those chairs in the music room?\n",
      "I don't care if she's Miss Hairless America... I'm spoken for. Now step aside -- I'll save Gloria myself.\n",
      "How old are you, anyway?\n",
      "Well, it's quite simple, really. I observed our friend Groundskeeper Willie burning leaves with a blatant disregard for our clean air laws.\n",
      "Thank you for finding it, sweetie. And seeing someone else get married in it is better than having it myself.\n",
      "It's great, Dad. You have tremendous power. And now it's time to put it to use.\n",
      "Oooh, the walls are melting again.\n",
      "Enjoy it now, because when you're a grown up, you'll have to take care of yourself.\n",
      "Excellent. Let me fetch you another Thomas Collins.\n",
      "Drive to Chicago? I don't have time for that. I have to be back at work on Monday. And my boss is a total jerk.\n",
      "That man can't remember anything except our number!\n",
      "Uh oh.\n",
      "Ugghh, Homer. Where did you get that ugly thing?\n",
      "I want you to just sit there, look through the window and watch me eat a ham. Marge, prepare the emergency ham.\n",
      "You must've found out about my letters. They were just a joke.\n",
      "Is there anything you need?\n",
      "Who's Chase?\n",
      "Homer, I told you he wouldn't sleep through it.\n",
      "He's cheating on Selma? That's crazy! Why go out for a hamburger when you've got rancid steak at home?\n",
      "Treason?! But I love France! The way all our words are either a girl or a guy! Oh, that's the best!\n",
      "I never got any. And I never painted again.\n",
      "Please welcome new panelist, Barney Gumbel.\n",
      "No, I want roast beef, you clod!\n",
      "So, what are we going to see?\n",
      "While I'm here, I might as well pre-punch out...\n",
      "The Skin-man doesn't give up that easily.\n",
      "Calm down there, Homer.\n",
      "Flanders? Kill me? You never killed anybody... and you're gonna start with the big dog?\n",
      "Oh, by the way, I was being sarcastic.\n",
      "Hey, idiot. You're fat, and your Mom's naked on the internet. You also smell.\n",
      "Your Honor! May I say something?\n",
      "You can't keep this scoreboard -- because there's not gonna be any grant money! Because I cheated!\n",
      "My Malibu Stacy heads!\n",
      "Wow, Mom, I love tea!\n",
      "It's funny... it's poignant... it actually happened... My father is interesting?! The whole world's upside down! That must mean Cathy is funny.\n",
      "Yeah, till they find out about us.\n",
      "Some day you'll thank me for all this scary love! But now, I've gotta go somewhere and do some serious thinking.\n",
      "You went to the snack car?\n",
      "The devil? What devil?\n",
      "Hey! Wait a minute, if we're all out here, who's in there?\n",
      "No, of course not!\n",
      "You rule intensive care!\n",
      "Okay, where did you get these donuts?\n",
      "It wasn't me, boys! It was the train!\n",
      "Hey, there's still time. Let's hug him again.\n",
      "Dying alone, huh? Terrible fate to befall any woman -- ice-age or modern-day.\n",
      "Yeah, probably.\n",
      "Uh, well to truly master an instrument you'll need years of--\n",
      "Go on.\n",
      "Oh, the cereal's just a metaphor.\n",
      "All right, everybody in the pool!\n",
      "All right, all right. Look. I'm sorry. I-I got upset. In the heat of the moment, I said some things I didn't mean.\n",
      "Look. See. You're fine. And then--oops! Uh-oh. Look out...\n",
      "With our superior intellects, we could rebuild this city on a foundation of reason and enlightenment. We could turn Springfield into a utopia!\n",
      "So Bart... the little dickens... was gonna set off an explosion to break us up. Can you believe it?\n",
      "I just left my first session and I haven't even opened my mouth yet.\n",
      "Look Mom, look! I'm riding by myself!\n",
      "Now where do we go?\n",
      "Look, I know that to you we Simpsons are a lower order of life. We face that prejudice every day of our lives, but we are happy on our little planet. We throw ourselves on your mercy. Please return us to...\n",
      "Okay, boy, this is where all the hard work, sacrifice, and painful scaldings pay off.\n",
      "Actually, I've been working on a plan. During the exam, I'll hide under some coats and hope that somehow everything will work out.\n",
      "What the hell?\n",
      "Uh, you know, I think I'll take Maggie with us.\n",
      "Oh, you're not the jerk, I am. Forgive me? Oh, like you're Miss Perfect! Mom! Lisa's making me feel bad!\n",
      "What's going on, why are you attacking me? Look, if this is about me eating your heart pills, they shouldn't have made them in Good 'N' Plenty colors!\n",
      "B-b-but the poncho...\n",
      "Oh, it's beautiful, Dad.\n",
      "Langdon Alger.\n",
      "Stop -- in the name of a private citizen with no connection to the law!\n",
      "Don't mind me boys, just scrubbing my undies.\n",
      "My daughter.\n",
      "Clothesline.\n",
      "To sweeten the deal, I'll pick you first for basketball.\n",
      "Thanks, Lance.\n",
      "Bart!\n",
      "On a poker site!\n",

      "What?\n",
      "That's it, young man. You're coming with me...\n",

      "Well, there's no house to put it in, Homer, not since that nice fellow from the bank, who was only doing his job, came and locked it up.\n",
      "Oh cheer up, Homer. The drinks are on Lenny.\n",
      "Hey, you should see how much trouble Dad's having shaving with a straight razor.\n",
      "Oh, I thought I'd check out the Warner Brothers Network.\n",

      "Ah, who am I kiddin'? I ain't smiled for real since I nailed that rat with the ice pick. Ha, remember that?\n",
      "Bart, I've asked you not to whistle that annoying tune.\n",
      "Well, your arms are lanky. It's kind of a long trip down there.\n",
      "I've got to win this one. I've bribed everyone in Hollywood.\n",
      "Ooh, baby!\n",
      "No... This whole thing is my fault. I've been a lousy dad.\n",
      "C'mon, Marge. This place is great. Free admission, great grub and we got to use the bathroom of the future.\n",
      "Who the hell is that? Some kind of leader?\n",
      "So, Twiggy, I hear you and your husband Woody just had a baby. What did you name him?\n",
      "You, stupid...\n",
      "Yeah Marge, it looks like you got the last perfect man. Oh uh, by the way... can I borrow your car tomorrow? Mine's acting up.\n",
      "Y'ello.\n",
      "And Bart isn't doing very well either. He needs boundaries, and structure. There's something about flying a kite at night that's so unwholesome.\n",
      "So, uh, what's your hurry to get to school?\n",
      "I just don't understand what the problem is.\n",
      "That's it! I'm calling my buddies. Marge is not the only one who can have a girls' night out.\n",
      "Okay, send the truck.\n",
      "Woo hoo!\n",
      "Nice touch.\n",
      "Oh, he just wants to make friends.\n",

      "Like all young people, I had a musical dream.\n",
      "Oh man, this is priceless, but I can't keep it up. You've still got a college fund.\n",

      "Damnit!\n",
      "I'm going to take me home a toilet!\n",
      "Stop that. Okay, okay. You win. I'll teach you how to make love to your wife!\n",
      "So Homer, how'd you do?\n",
      "Yeah, well, we're adding clowns.\n",
      "Sound off!\n",
      "Yeah, that's it, slink away.\n",
      "Balderdash! Teddy Roosevelt protected America's wildlife!\n",
      "Yeah. Thanks for the tip, Homer...\n",
      "No Bart, no. Do it and you'll always be known as the kid who ate the dead frog.\n",
      "I was thinking something more artistic. Something musical. You could take advantage of a fantastic musician living right here!\n",
      "Steak?\n",
      "Damn these sturdy foreign-built phones!\n",
      "No, why?\n",
      "Is it done yet? Is it done yet?\n",

      "Good work, Dad.\n",

      "It's good to have you back with the Simpsons.\n",
      "Drop the backpack, Jack.\n",
      "Don't worry. This is the score we've been dreamin' about. The grease traps in this kitchen have never been emptied.\n",
      "And the winner is... Lisa Simpson!\n",
      "Time for Homer's half-time show. Get ready, Frank.\n",

      "Marge! We're out of bath towels.\n",
      "Homer, maybe you better take Milhouse home.\n",

      "Oh, Homie!\n",
      "It's really important that you read it and tell me what you think.\n",

      "It's better if you don't.\n",
      "I'll do that! You go upstairs and have a beer.\n",
      "Oh... so that's why everyone's been sayin' that all summer.\n",

      "Me, too!\n",
      "Marge? I have an apology that I hope is better than all the other ones. So please listen carefully. The thing I liked best about being an ice cream man wasn't the free ice cream, or the colorful toppings, or the love I received from obese children. It was giving you those sticks, and watching you smile as you turned them into art.\n",

      "Mom, you said I could have one souvenir, right? Well I want a didgeridoo.\n",
      "Homer!\n",
      "Yes, of course -- I think we can wrangle you a used bicycle. Do you prefer Schwinn or Huffy? Bart? Where did he-- My car keys!\n",
      "Where are the refreshments?\n",
      "Yes, Mr. Burns.\n",
      "Sorry, Dad -- this is our thing now.\n",
      "That's bad.\n",
      "Mmm... pancakes.\n",
      "Yeah, Moe, that team sure did suck last night! They just plain sucked! I've seen teams suck before, but they were the suckiest bunch of sucks that ever sucked!\n",
      "This broom closet is not what it seems. It's a secret surveillance room, guarded by a tiny, evil robot.\n",
      "All right, you're not a coward. And that's beside the point because--\n",
      "Never gonna happen.\n",
      "Hm, maybe there is something in there.\n",
      "I told you! I find them boring.\n",
      "Really? Hmmm.\n",
      "Thank you!\n",
      "Now, enjoy your game and the madcap antics of the free-wheeling title-holder of this asset: me!\n",
      "promised Marge...\n",
      "The one thing I couldn't prepare for.\n",
      "He's giving them a bath!\n",
      "I really thought I could handle this, but...\n",
      "That's not Grampa. Dad's just dehydrated.\n",
      "You'd be surprised what he could do if you just gave him a chance.\n",
      "Dad, I hate to break the mood, but I'm getting nauseous.\n",
      "I saw this picture at Grandma's house, then I hit the pet stores till I found one that looked just like it.\n",
      "Gee, is it always this good?\n",
      "Well, sir... when we got married, I knew I'd find some spices in my chili. I guess they can go to Springfield Hellementary.\n",
      "I mailed them the answer but they never printed it.\n",
      "You heard me -- They're alien replicons from beyond the moon!\n",
      "Semper fi.\n",
      "Oh guys, it was horrible. I saw Marge kissing a far superior man.\n",
      "Look, if it were up to me, I'd be harassing them with you. If anything, I'd be the guy who took it too far. But I love my wife and I want to win her back!\n",
      "Last year, you spent five thousand dollars on donuts, two thousand on scalp massages, five hundred on body glitter--\n",
      "Face it, you're not the most mechanical guy in the world. But you're good at other things: like... eating while driving. That's somethin'... and nobody gets madder at the news.\n",
      "Quiet -- we're missing the dissection!\n",
      "I want to set the record straight. I thought the cop was a prostitute.\n",
      "Enough chit-chat. I need to see Lisa.\n",
      "I never thought I'd say this, but I missed you guys. Even what's her name, Lisa.\n",
      "Dad, where are you going?\n",
      "Well, sir, for one thing we had a problem every Tuesday, when the cafeteria would serve fish sticks.\n",
      "But it's summertime -- the ice bridge will be a water nothing.\n",
      "Arrrgh!\n",
      "What are you talking about, Marge? I don't need a...\n",
      "Homer, what's wrong?\n",
      "Homer, taking an officer's cap is an arrestable offense.\n",
      "Hey boy, come here! You're a good dog! Come on, we don't need them to get a Thanksgiving dinner!\n",
      "Nothin's ever gonna stop me.\n",
      "Would the world judge me harshly if I threw away the key?\n",
      "He seemed to know a lot about brunch. But it turned out he wasn't interested in brunch at all.\n",
      "Lisa. I'll miss you when this is all over.\n",
      "Runaway Truck Lane! We're saved!\n",
      "Guys, believe me, I didn't mean to get you expelled...\n",
      "Oh, too much junk in the trunk, eh?\n",
      "Oh, just some blueprints Adil wanted. I'm telling you, he's such a curious little dickens. I bet he could build a nuclear power plant if he wanted to.\n",
      "Uggams!\n",
      "Who's a possum? You're a possum.\n",
      "Dear Pus Bag...\n",
      "Can I just ask, who the hell says potato?\n",
      "Well, let's see how you do against twenty-year-old Homer.\n",
      "Hey, don't make me hassle you, Lisa.\n",
      "It's just you and me tonight, Buttermilk.\n",
      "Come on, come on. We were worried about you. Nothing personal. I just fear the unfamiliar.\n",
      "Watch the fish, Marge.\n",
      "I don't know... date a chick with kids...\n",
      "This is the life.\n",
      "Obesity is really unhealthy. Any doctor will tell you that.\n",
      "Hello, Marge?\n",
      "I love you, Homey. Heh, heh, heh. I don't need her at all anymore.\n",
      "Quiet nerds burp only near school.\n",
      "Oh, my God, he is like some sort of non... giving up... school guy.\n",
      "Okay. Hang on, Homer. Two eye holes coming up!\n",
      "Oh my God! It's the opportunity of a lifetime!\n",
      "I think it's nice we're doing something Maggie will enjoy for once. Besides, I'm sure Storytown Village is also fun for everyone... from 8, to... God only knows.\n",
      "Well that is your problem, Ralph. This is how I always walk.\n",
      "Ho, ho... if he's as smart as he is funny, I'm sold.\n",
      "Work out!\n",
      "I don't know. I feel naked without it.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Today I received an education in how children really learn: by seeing their principal run around on top of a shipping container.\n",
      "Well, if you don't feel the way Greta does, you've got to tell her before she gets hurt.\n",
      "Oh, they found it. But don't tell him. This is way cheaper than a nursing home.\n",
      "Stand aside, Marge. I'm taking the boy deer hunting. He's going to grow up straight for once.\n",
      "Cheating!\n",
      "Shut up, Flanders.\n",
      "Look at you! Idiots!\n",
      "You know, I could save money by buying separate nuts and mixing them at home.\n",
      "Homer! Wake up! The car's filling with...\n",
      "They say we're contaminating the planet.\n",
      "She's still your mother. Come inside.\n",
      "Come on, this isn't a joke. All over town, kids are just waking up from their naps, cranky and hungry for the news.\n",
      "As big as a baby's head.\n",
      "I'll also need to remove your tattoo.\n",
      "Oh my God. That's, that's shattering. And now, I'm a man in pain in the naughtiest city since San Francisco turned all nerdy.\n",
      "Woo-Hoo! In your face Milwaukee!\n",
      "Now to drop gracefully through the windshield.\n",
      "C'mon, guys. Free pickled eggs.\n",
      "And there's one Itchy and Scratchy cartoon I don't think we'll ever forget.\n",
      "Ugh, that antenna is an eyesore.\n",
      "Yes, Mother.\n",
      "Oh, that submarine's so fake... Look, you can see the strings... Ooh! An octopus!\n",
      "Why did you rat me out, kids? Was it because I showered love on those other children while ignoring you?\n",
      "That's them all right. I can't believe it. I guess you're the only one I can trust...\n",
      "But... but I...\n",
      "Mom, I found your wedding dress!\n",
      "Awww.\n",
      "Step into our Jerkatorium.\n",
      "I, uh, hope it's twins!\n",
      "What? You can't take my Balderdash!\n",
      "I'm goin' home. It's not safe in here.\n",
      "Brief nudityyy!\n",
      "Whoa, whoa, one question at a time. Yes, you?\n",
      "But I'm considering it because I want to share your world forever.\n",
      "Guess I forgot to put the fog lights in...\n",
      "Woo hoo!\n",
      "What?\n",
      "I think I'm done here. Lisa, go nuts.\n",
      "No, no!\n",
      "So that's it? All my dreams, lived?\n",
      "Bad cat!\n",
      "Well, I think what you're doing for Mrs. Glick is very nice. The poor old thing doesn't have anybody.\n",
      "Why Flanders, you rogue.\n",
      "All right, all right. It's Lisa's turn.\n",
      "The Chri... I-I-I don't think you understand my objection...\n",
      "Just because it's too hip for you, Smithers...\n",
      "I hardly ever let Mother fight for me anymore!\n",
      "Even love is boring when you're stuck in a tunnel of it. Why can't this be the Tunnel of Hockey Fights?\n",
      "Mr. Hutz! This was all a misunderstanding. I didn't mean to take anything.\n",
      "And check these out...\n",
      "Let's see him track me now.\n",
      "Stop it right now.\n",
      "Will you quit staring at me like that!\n",
      "Um... who says we're gonna have kids of our own?\n",
      "Oh, hello friends. I'm Montgomery Burns, your next governor, and I'm here to talk to you about my little friend, here. Blinky.\n",
      "Bart!\n",
      "Well, it's... Ah, you wouldn't be interested. It's too low brow.\n",
      "ROCK AND ROLL.\n",
      "Krusty, would you do the honors?\n",
      "Lady's choice.\n",
      "I'm not pouting. I'm... mourning. Stupid dead woman.\n",
      "Leeches!\n",
      "Woo hoo! Oh, uh, if an emergency alarm goes off, there's earplugs in the top drawer!\n",
      "Really? Look, boy! Now I'm in Australia! Now I'm in America!\n",
      "It's closing?! But where will people find clips of old TV shows if they're not housed in a giant building? Where? Where?\n",
      "When did he lose his cuteness?\n",
      "Hot dog!\n",
      "Ew, I can't watch this.\n",
      "And that's how a presidential veto gets overridden. Any questions?\n",
      "Bart, I couldn't help noticing Buck is a total fraud. So I took the liberty of creating a new hero for your wall.\n",
      "Aye carumba!\n",
      "Relax, what's the worst that could happen?\n",
      "Sorry, White Stripes. No hard feelings?\n",
      "Oh of course you'd say something like that, Marge. You've hated Ned for years. In fact, you wanted to bash his head in with a pipe.\n",
      "What does a competitive eater eat?\n",
      "I'm hungry. Are they married yet?\n",
      "Lenny! Wake up!\n",
      "Uh-oh. I think I ate a dog food lid.\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "But what if I were to shake your hand in this wise?\n",
      "Yes, that's it! Lisa, you oughta be a doorbell salesman!\n",
      "This is so generous. How can I ever repay you?\n",
      "Jewel-encrusted?\n",
      "How 'bout cooking up some money because this stupid kitchen cost a hundred thousand dollars.\n",
      "Yes, sir. Yes, sir. Can I get a four fifty-five wakeup call?\n",
      "Um... She's so beautiful. It makes my heart take wing!\n",
      "Tree!\n",
      "Homer is so amazing! He can chug a beer and pitch woo at the same time.\n",
      "But what are these wings? Oh, it's just a seagull stuck in my back.\n",
      "Are you ready?\n",
      "LET THEM PLAY! WE WON'T LOOK, WE'LL TURN AWAY / GO MAKE LOVE, THEN EAT SOME HAY...\n",
      "Not yet, but at least I'm in a lot of pain.\n",
      "All right.\n",
      "Grampa, you said that about all the presents.\n",
      "But Marge, the barflies are expecting me... Moe, and Barney and that guy who calls me Bill...\n",
      "She could get hurt!\n",
      "No Marge, I love when you do that. You're a regular Carin' A-lot-ovich.\n",
      "Perhaps I may be of help.\n",
      "I thought I'd be jumping for joy the day Skinner left, but now all I have is this weird hot feeling in the back of my head.\n",
      "Uh... shoes, butt-back?\n",
      "Bart! Where do you pick up words like that?\n",
      "Hey, as long as he's got eight fingers and eight toes, he's fine by me.\n",
      "Problem: a pointy deity. And I've got the perfect solution.\n",
      "Hey, Flanders gave us toothpaste.\n",
      "Ow! Ow! God help me!\n",
      "Is that Mom?\n",
      "Rubes... so many rubes... pounding me with their jet skis... rubes! Please, no rubes...\n",
      "Now, it's my turn to roll the dice! Wanna kiss them for me?\n",
      "Well, what'd you think?\n",
      "If I couldn't spend the treasure on Edner, I didn't want to spend it. I just sat there playin' our song on the jukebox. One gold--\n",
      "Hey, Bashir's great. If Derek Jeter married Mariah Carey, it wouldn't last, but I bet they'd have a kid like him.\n",
      "C'mon, boy! Be cool!\n",
      "Did you make that awful effigy?\n",
      "But I'll just draw bunny faces on them to scare Maggie away.\n",
      "I know a little something about history. Gather 'round.\n",
      "Ew, you're sitting on the toilet.\n",
      "Naw, that's okay. I'm broke. I'll walk home.\n",
      "Wow, I'd really like to meet this guy.\n",
      "Homer Simpson! Did you take Maggie to Moe's?\n",
      "Let's see. Upper, upper, upper mezzanine. Hmmm. Yes, these must be ours.\n",
      "I know, I know. It's never easy.\n",
      "Oh, and for yourself.\n",
      "Who told you these things about me?!\n",
      "Now just turn around and count to three.\n",
      "I forgave you for accidentally killing my wife.\n",
      "Oh no, I can't believe it.\n",
      "We don't get what?\n",
      "Marge, forget it. He's bigger than me, faster than me, stronger than me and he already has more friends around the plant than I do.\n",
      "I don't know, but he's algaefying.\n",
      "I don't think you've thought this through.\n",
      "I might have.\n",
      "Don't worry. I have a secret weapon -- one more powerful than any gun.\n",
      "Where we going? Where we going?\n",
      "The suit wasn't magic, Moe. Don't you know the story of Dumbo the elephant?\n",
      "And there's some more!\n",
      "Jealous?\n",
      "Look, Grampa, I'm fine! I really don't need any more home remedies.\n",
      "We're going to that game party and we're going to be charming and witty.\n",
      "And if elected president of our small community, I will determine once and for all how far we can go without being gay.\n",
      "Solid. The rest of you, go on home and look in your mailboxes. 'Cause I totally remember sending checks out.\n",
      "Uh-oh, here comes a Xylon cruiser. Whoa, whoa, whoa! Go into hyperspace! Ready, hit it!\n",
      "It's a town filled with winners...and Skinners.\n",
      "Now for a victory cigar.\n",
      "Flanders!\n",
      "Mmmm. Hog fat.\n",
      "Stop the madness! Start the movie!\n",
      "I am, and you seem more interested in my day than my husband!\n",
      "Son, I've learned one thing in this life: to stay out of trouble, just say nothing. Don't rock the boat. Don't even get in the boat.\n",
      "Twenty-three skidoo!\n",
      "I can't hear you. Wait! Fly into my saxophone!\n",
      "Nope.\n",
      "I have the power!\n",
      "Oh, Dad...\n",
      "Can't make a float without flowers.\n",
      "Now, there'll be no more trouble from that meddlesome bartender.\n",
      "Oh, I only wanted to show my school spirit.\n",
      "...Then Father Sean quoted Eminem in his sermon. And in art class, we painted Saint Joan burning at the stake, and mine was the grossest! Catholics rock!\n",
      "I'm going to find that golden ticket and win that tour! The only thing that can make bacon more delicious is seeing how it's made!\n",
      "Quit runnin', son. I just want to give ya a big hug!\n",
      "And I'm a college student! Heh, heh.\n",
      "Sports?\n",
      "I'd commit arson for the Parson, clergymen can kiss my apse, all kindsa gems. Surprisingly, none of them have sold. Except for this one.\n",
      "Uh oh.\n",
      "Indeed I did.\n",
      "In a little while.\n",
      "Why?\n",
      "Will do.\n",
      "Thanks, Mr. Murphy.\n",
      "You certainly have a lot of bowling trophies.\n",
      "You went to Springfield U. You hate A & M.\n",
      "When uranium came from a stream...and atoms were split by hand...then transformed into the kind of electricity that illuminated not just our homes, but our souls as well?\n",
      "Absolutely. I want you and your pals to go away to Camp David and write up a report on coolness.\n",
      "Marge!\n",
      "It's simple. We just have to cause a riot at the Springfield Shoe Expo.\n",
      "Poor dumb country mouse. Can't even count.\n",
      "Let's go get fried chicken!\n",
      "Can I wear your jewelry?\n",
      "Homer, the mob is puttin' the screws on me, see. I ain't gettin' killed 'cause you won't pay your tab. Now give me fifty bucks!\n",
      "Your four eyes saw a lot today, Milhouse. What's the skinny?\n",
      "Couldn't agree more. Happy as a clam.\n",
      "Greetings from Nedily Space Center on Cape Flandaveral. We noticed your sky-ro-technics and thought we'd join in. Ooh, looks like a perfect landing!\n",
      "You what?!\n",
      "Good-bye Lis. I hope you get reincarnated as someone who can stay awake for fifteen minutes.\n",
      "Maybe he had a good reason to give you the ultimate screw-over.\n",
      "Before you go, could you hire your own replacement? But make sure she's not crazy like you.\n",
      "Dad, I've got some bad news.\n",
      "Go! Go! Go!\n",
      "Science is like a blabbermouth who ruins a movie by telling you how it ends. Well, I say there are some things we don't want to know! Important things!\n",
      "Sadly, no.\n",
      "Oh, of course. I'm sorry, I... I don't get out to restaurants much.\n",
      "All drivers must be over the age of twenty-five... and check.\n",
      "Hey! I'm Bart Simpson's father, and I'm sick of you teaching my son your time-tested values! Hey, what's that smell?\n",
      "But you could lose everything. Come on.\n",
      "Da-ad --\n",
      "Even bonnets?\n",
      "Hey, every witch needs a familiar...\n",
      "Mom, I'm sorry I'm late! No excuse, I just forgot all about you. Huh? I'm not sure that patch really represents who I am right now.\n",
      "I'm Homer Simpson. I just took your test. I got a zero.\n",
      "Oh, So full... Bellybutton moving from innie to outie...\n",
      "What happened here?\n",
      "And fill it to the top this time.\n",
      "Smooth as a baby's behind.\n",
      "Dad, that's a bomb!\n",
      "Man, this story is filling in a lot of gaps.\n",
      "That's just what I was going for! I was going for Scary.\n",
      "Hey, Marge. Partaking of the grape, were we?\n",
      "Dad, you should listen to him. He's a man of science and you can barely read!\n",
      "Okay, okay, I didn't ask for your life story.\n",
      "Oh...\n",
      "What do we want?\n",
      "Okay, here's the solution -- I want you kids to lock the bedroom from the outside, so I can't get out and perpetrate my nocturnal mischief.\n",
      "How are you going to find him?\n",
      "Eh, you said it, Barn.\n",
      "Yes. Yes I do.\n",

      "It's my room!\n",
      "Homer!\n",

      "Okay. Ready.\n",
      "Oh. This other cheese cube's stuck to the first one. Well, that still technically counts as one.\n",

      "I owe it all to my rewarding work with children, and not picking at it.\n",
      "You see.\n",
      "Now, did you get Kirk's license?\n",
      "Oh, don't listen to my husband. He's just an idiot. Now, I'm a veterinarian and I need to keep lots of sick animals in my house. Is that permitted?\n",
      "Here you go, lad.\n",
      "BART!!!! Mmm... apple.\n",
      "Oh well, Thank you, Doctor, you've changed my life!\n",
      "Ay carumba. Hey, is that the Ark of the Covenant?\n",
      "Oh Homer, not again.\n",
      "I can't complain.\n",
      "Milhouse?\n",
      "No, no, no, it's great. I'm done with it now.\n",
      "Lincoln was only one man.\n",
      "What's fun about fire ants? They're-- Oh, you're being sarcastic.\n",
      "I'll write the letter.\n",
      "Honey, I know you're scared. But there's no boogie woogies or wooly bullies out there.\n",
      "Bart, someone wrote something cynical on your shirt!\n",
      "It's me... Ned.\n",
      "Okay, I've gotten rid of all of my distractions, diversions, hobbies and... Oh my God!\n",
      "I guess.\n",
      "There's no need for apologies, guys. You're rock stars! You're supposed to be reckless and destructive, and be celebrated for behavior that would land normal people in jail.\n",
      "Why did I ever have kids? I could have written symphonies, or been Shakespeare.\n",
      "So many cookies will never be born...\n",
      "We've got to go to the police.\n",
      "Right away, sir. I-I-I don't want no trouble.\n",
      "Homer, can I speak to you in private?\n",
      "Ahhhh!\n",

      "MR. BO-JANGLES / MR. BO-JANGLES / WE'RE ALL BO-JANGLES / WHO KILLED BO-JANGLES? / MAYBE IT WAS YOU...\n",
      "They put a sticker over my face!\n",
      "How you doin', Dad?\n",
      "I am only eighty-one. You may find this hard to believe... but in my salad days, my crowning glory was a bright shock of strawberry blond curls.\n",
      "Noooo!!\n",
      "I sorta skipped school.\n",
      "No! No! No-o-o-o-o!\n",
      "Why don't you have the colonel's wife save you?\n",
      "Hey, Bart, watch me run down this old lady.\n",
      "We will do this until we get it right.\n",
      "Oh heavenly God, my son is plagued with homework. With your vast knowledge of the shore birds of Maryland, I know you can help him.\n",
      "Don't you push them! They've gotta work that out for themselves.\n",
      "Prepare to be disappointed!\n",
      "I'll save you!\n",
      "What are you going to do?\n",
      "You promised you wouldn't get mad!\n",
      "Let Automobile Von Bismarck give it a try.\n",
      "Smithers, I'm licked. You open this can.\n",
      "Check it out! I'm Tomokaz Ohka of the Montreal Expos.\n",
      "That was a weird day.\n",
      "Yeah, I guess the next place he robs better have a ramp.\n",
      "Hey, what's going on here, something crazy?\n",
      "Ahhhhhh!\n",
      "It's just a legal thing, to protect me.\n",
      "Yes, he's in Geneva, chairing a conference on Nuclear Fission. Yes, that should stick.\n",
      "Bart Simpson, I'm just big-boned.\n",
      "My Dad, the drug mule.\n",
      "Attention parents, children and childless weirdoes. My son and I are going to build Westminster Abbey!\n",
      "Ah, something troubles me about Indian gaming. On the one hand, the revenue helps the tribes...\n",
      "O-kay then.\n",
      "Homer, maybe you'd have had more fun at Moe's tonight.\n",
      "Dad, don't eat the bees!\n",
      "Yeah, that was a scary coupla hours.\n",
      "Wow, thanks Sparkle. Wait, this isn't you.\n",
      "Why you little...!\n",
      "Ya know, I think I'll volunteer, too.\n",
      "Hey, look what was in here. A program from that guy's funeral.\n",
      "A diner!?\n",
      "Oh can't you see this man isn't a hero! He's annoying. He's very, very annoying!\n",
      "Homer, what you do is go down to window nine at the courthouse. You slip the guy a hundred bucks and your record is as clean as... uh, I ain't got nothin' clean to compare it to.\n",
      "Well, okay. But you can't silence Homer Simpson. I'm the friend of the downtrodden. And I'm not gonna forget what I saw here today.\n",
      "Good morning, dear.\n",
      "That's right. All his talk of peace and love is really honking off my red Chinese masters. Now Smithers, walk me around the park until I fall asleep. I'm feeling fussy.\n",
      "Here she comes! And-a one and-a two and-a...\n",
      "La la la la la...\n",
      "Uh, I don't think so.\n",
      "That's my mom, I gotta go. I finished nailing this board.\n",
      "Oh my God, what happened to your fingers?!\n",
      "Come on, people! Move it! I want to see some sweat!\n",
      "'Cause Marge and I have one thing that can never be broken: a strong marriage built on a solid foundation of routine.\n",
      "Me Homer. Me hiding from PBS.\n",
      "I am waiting for a bus.\n",
      "Edna, I'm not one for costumes, but I sure do like that feather in your hair.\n",
      "They took my cupcakes!\n",
      "Well, at Sunday School we learned that stealing is a sin.\n",
      "Yay!! We're getting a new TV!!\n",
      "Society's loss, I suppose. But our marriage has been through hard times and we always pull through.\n",
      "Oh, right. What'd you get her, Dad?\n",
      "Good. Does anyone else have a love story?\n",
      "Flushing Meadows...\n",
      "Okay. All right. You can bluff your way through one test.\n",
      "Homer, quit playing that back.\n",
